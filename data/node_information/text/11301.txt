Venus May Have Supported Life Billions of Years Ago

   By Samantha Mathewson 2019-09-23T18:04:10Z Science & Astronomy

   Drastic climate shifts 700 million years ago made the planet's
   atmosphere incredibly dense and hot.

   The hellish planet Venus may have had a perfectly habitable environment
   for 2 to 3 billion years after the planet formed, suggesting life would
   have had ample time to emerge there, according to a new study.

   In 1978, NASA's Pioneer Venus spacecraft found evidence that the planet
   may have once had shallow oceans on its surface. Since then, several
   missions have investigated the planet's surface and atmosphere,
   revealing new details on how it transitioned from an "Earth-like"
   planet to the hot, hellish place it is today.

   It's believed that Venus may have been a temperate planet hosting
   liquid water for 2 to 3 billion years before a massive resurfacing
   event about 700 million years ago triggered a runaway greenhouse
   effect, which caused the planet's atmosphere to become incredibly dense
   and hot.

   Related: What Would It Be Like to Live on Venus?

   Researchers from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies shared a
   series of five simulations that show what Venus' environment would be
   like based on different levels of water coverage.

   All five of the simulations suggest Venus may have been able to
   maintain stable temperatures, ranging from a low of 68 degrees
   Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) to a high of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50
   degrees Celsius), for about 3 billion years, according to a statement
   from the Europlanet Society.

   "Our hypothesis is that Venus may have had a stable climate for
   billions of years," Michael Way, one of the study researchers, said in
   the statement. "It is possible that the near-global resurfacing event
   is responsible for its transformation from an Earth-like climate to the
   hellish hot-house we see today."

   Under stable climate conditions, Venus would have been able to support
   liquid water and, in turn, possibly allow life to emerge. In fact, if
   the planet hadn't experienced the resurfacing event, it might have
   remained habitable today, the researchers said.

   However, the resurfacing event triggered a series of incidents that
   caused a release, or outgassing, of carbon dioxide stored in the rocks
   of the planet. As a result, Venus' atmosphere became too dense and hot
   for life to survive.

   Creating the different simulations involved adapting a 3D
   general-circulation model, which accounted for atmospheric compositions
   as they were 4.2 billion years ago and 715 million years ago, and as
   they are today. The model also accounts for the gradual increase in
   solar radiation, as the sun gets warmer over the course of its
   lifetime.

   In addition, three of the five scenarios assumed the topography of
   Venus was similar to what it is today. In these scenarios, the ocean
   ranged from a shallow depth of about 30 feet (10 meters) to about 1,000
   feet (310 m), with a small amount of water locked in the soil.

   For comparison, the researchers also considered a scenario in which the
   planet's topography was similar to Earth's with an ocean 1,000 feet
   (310 m) deep, as well as a scenario where the entire surface of Venus
   was covered in a 500-foot-deep (158 m) ocean, according to the
   statement.

   "Venus currently has almost twice the solar radiation that we have at
   Earth. However, in all the scenarios we have modeled, we have found
   that Venus could still support surface temperatures amenable for liquid
   water," Way said in the statement. However, "something happened on
   Venus where a huge amount of gas was released into the atmosphere and
   couldn't be re-absorbed by the rocks."

   Beginning 4.2 billion years ago, soon after the planet formed, Venus
   would have undergone a period of rapid cooling. As the planet evolved,
   silicate rocks would have slowly absorbed carbon dioxide from the
   atmosphere and locked it away in the planet's crust.

   By 715 million years ago, the atmosphere of Venus would likely have
   been dominated by nitrogen with trace amounts of carbon dioxide and
   methane — much like Earth's today. The simulations suggest these
   conditions could have remained stable up until present times, if a
   massive outgassing event hadn't occurred.

   While the exact cause of the outgassing event is still unknown, it's
   possible that it's linked to the planet's volcanic activity. As magma
   and molten rock bubbled up to the planet's surface, large amounts of
   carbon dioxide would have been released back into the atmosphere. If
   the magma had solidified before reaching the surface, it would have
   created a barrier and prevented gas from being reabsorbed, the
   researchers said.

   Similar events have occurred in Earth's past. For example, the Siberian
   Traps is one of the largest known volcanic events in the last 500
   million years. This event released toxic amounts of greenhouse gases
   into the atmosphere and caused a mass extinction, the researchers
   said.

   "We need more missions to study Venus and get a more detailed
   understanding of its history and evolution," Way said. "However, our
   models show that there is a real possibility that Venus could have been
   habitable and radically different from the Venus we see today. This
   opens up all kinds of implications for exoplanets found in what is
   called the 'Venus Zone', which may in fact host liquid water and
   temperate climates."

   Their findings were presented Sept. 20 at the Joint Meeting of the
   European Planetary Science Congress and the American Astronomical
   Society's Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS), in Geneva.

'Alien Megastructure' Star May Not Be So Special After All

   A mysterious star whose repeated bouts of darkening might be due to
   "alien megastructures," according to some researchers' conjectures, may
   now have more than a dozen counterparts that display similarly
   mystifying behavior, a new study finds.

   Further research into all of these stars might help solve the puzzle of
   their bewildering flickering, the study's author said.

   In 2015, scientists noticed unusual fluctuations in the light from a
   star named KIC 8462852. This otherwise-normal F-type star, which is
   slightly larger and hotter than Earth's sun, sits about 1,480
   light-years from Earth, in the constellation Cygnus.

   When the researchers analyzed data from NASA's Kepler space telescope,
   astronomer Tabetha "Tabby" Boyajian, then at Yale University, and her
   colleagues found dozens of odd instances of KIC 8462852 dimming by up
   to 22%, with such dips lasting anywhere from a few days to a week.
   These events did not appear to follow any pattern and seemed far too
   substantial to be caused by planets or dust crossing the star's face.

   These analyses of KIC 8462852 — now nicknamed "Boyajian's star"
   (formerly Tabby's star) after its discoverer — raised the possibility
   that astronomers had detected signs of intelligent alien life.
   Specifically, researchers have suggested that the star is surrounded by
   a Dyson sphere, a hypothetical megastructure that is built around a
   star to capture as much of its light as possible. Mathematician and
   physicist Freeman Dyson suggested that such megastructures could help
   power an advanced civilization. (Science fiction often depicts Dyson
   spheres as solid shells around stars, but the megastructures also could
   be globular swarms of giant solar panels.)

   The megastructure hypothesis is near the bottom of most astronomers'
   lists these days when it comes to Boyajian's star, however; further
   analyses have pointed to more prosaic explanations, such as clouds of
   dust or comet fragments. Still, scientists have not yet nailed down the
   precise cause of the odd dimming.  The answer remains elusive in part
   because Boyajian's star seemed unique; there were no known counterparts
   to provide additional clues that might help researchers solve this
   cosmic mystery.

   Now, study author Edward Schmidt, an astrophysicist at the University
   of Nebraska-Lincoln, suggests that he may have discovered more than a
   dozen stars like Boyajian's star.

   Schmidt looked for counterparts of Boyajian's star using software that
   searched for analogous dimming events from about 14 million objects
   with varying brightness monitored in the Northern Sky Variable Survey
   from April 1999 to March 2000. He then followed up on promising
   candidates by examining their long-term behavior, using data from the
   All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, ruling out sources whose
   dimming could be caused by conventional explanations such as an
   eclipsing companion star or some intrinsic variability in brightness.

   Schmidt identified 21 stars that showed possibly unusual dimming. These
   fell into two distinct categories: 15 were "slow dippers" that dimmed
   at rates similar to Boyajian's star, and six were "rapid dippers" that
   showed even more extreme variability in their dimming rates.

   "The thing that surprised me the most were these stars that had so many
   dips, the ones I called 'rapid dippers,'" Schmidt told Space.com. "I
   expected more occasional dips like Boyajian's star."

   Further analysis using data from the European Space Agency's Gaia space
   observatory found that these potential dippers tended to be either
   conventional "main-sequence" stars with about the same mass as the sun
   or red giant stars with about twice the sun's mass. The slow and rapid
   dippers are seen in both groups, which may suggest that they represent
   varying degrees of the same mechanism, Schmidt said.

   Schmidt noted that the Northern Sky Variable Survey he searched for
   potential counterparts of Boyajian's star did not contain records of
   Boyajian's star itself darkening during the year of data in that
   catalog. This highlights how astronomers may easily miss stars that can
   darken in this manner if they look only at catalogs that monitor stars
   for relatively short intervals of time.

   "We're obviously missing some of these stars because of the catalogs we
   have," Schmidt said. "By looking at more catalogs, we may get a better
   picture of what's going on, even though it won't be a complete
   picture."

   Future research that combs through more catalogs of stellar activity
   may turn up even more analogues of Boyajian's star, he said.

   "I intend to try and follow up on the rapid dippers," Schmidt said.
   "One thing I noticed about them is that at least one seemed to be
   slowing way down in its dipping rate over the five years of coverage we
   have of it. It'd be interesting to find out what happened in its past,
   which may help give a better idea of what's going on with these stars."

   Schmidt detailed his findings July 18 in The Astrophysical Journal
   Letters.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin Secures Customer for New Glenn, Releases Video of
Rocket

   Blue Origin, billionaire Jeff Bezos' spaceflight company, has secured
   its first satellite customer for its orbital rocket, named New Glenn.
   The company also released a video illustrating how the reusable rocket
   will launch, deliver a payload and land its first-stage booster.

   The animated video shows a New Glenn rocket lifting off from what
   appears to be Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in
   Florida, which the company is leasing. High above the Earth, the
   rocket's first stage separates from the payload carrier, which then
   delivers a satellite into orbit; the first stage then returns to Earth
   and touches down vertically on a ship's landing pad.

   Blue Origin has now secured a contract to use New Glenn to launch a
   geostationary satellite for Eutelsat Communications, sometime in 2021
   or 2022, according to a statement from Eutelsat released today (March
   7). [Blue Origin's Giant New Glenn Rocket in Pictures]

   "In including New Glenn in our manifest, we are pursuing our
   longstanding strategy of innovation that drives down the cost of access
   to space and drives up performance," Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat
   CEO, said in the statement. "This can only be good news for the
   profitability and sustainability of our industry."

   The New Glenn rocket is named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, the
   first American to orbit Earth. Blue Origin has unveiled plans for
   two-stage and three-stage versions of New Glenn, both with a reusable
   first stage and an identical second stage. Each of the rockets will be
   powered by seven of the company's BE-4 engines (the optional third
   stage will use a BE-3 engine), burning liquefied natural gas and liquid
   oxygen. The company also has a contract to sell the BE-4 engines to
   United Launch Alliance to power its new Vulcan rocket.

   Bezos revealed new details about New Glenn at the Satellite 2017
   conference in Washington, D.C., this week, according to an article by
   SpaceNews reporter Jeff Foust. Bezos said New Glenn would be capable of
   launching up to 13 metric tons (about 28,000 lbs.) into geostationary
   transfer orbit and 45 metric tons (about 99,000 lbs.) into low-Earth
   orbit. That would make the rocket "one of the largest vehicles in
   service," according to Foust's article.

   booster will land on a ship.

   Blue Origin is also building a 750,000-square-foot production facility
   for its New Glenn rockets in Exploration Park, located next to NASA's
   Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

   The company has already made successful test launches of its suborbital
   New Shepard rocket, which the company plans to use to carry payloads
   and human passengers to suborbital heights. Those launches have
   included successful landings of the reusable New Shepard booster.
