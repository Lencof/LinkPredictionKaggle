   Terrible Place to work
   Investigative specialist (Former Employee) –  Cork – 5 May 2018
   No problems went above and beyond for them doing great work over target
   and one day decided to end my contract based on volume of work the
   company was receiving, Have a huge turn around in both customer service
   and fraud side would be weary about starting a job here you might be
   gone after a couple of months

   great place to work, a daily challenge that keeps you busy
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cork – 16 February 2017
   was only a seasonal worker and was laid off after 4 ramp downs, the
   work is rewarding, you get to help alot of people on a daily basis.
   really good wage and the managers are great. You get continual coaching
   every week too so you are continually improving on your skills. Would
   love to work there again. There is stability and progression in the job
   if you manage to get hired full time.
   Pros
   great pay and people
   Cons
   no stability for seasonal hires

   Productive and fun place to work. Was an amazing experience to work a s
   customer service advisor.
   French Customer Associate (Former Employee) –  Cork – 7 February 2017
   I uses to work 40 hours a week. Sometimes early shift and sometimes
   late shift which is not a problem for me. I've learnt a lot about
   customer advisor and how to help people with they problems delivery.
   What I most the like in this job was to rassure people that they will
   be refund or they will be receive ana another package really quickly.
   The hardest part was sometimes to calm down people whom were very
   upset.
   Cork city in Ireland is juste an amazing city to work and live except
   the weather..

   Horrible place to work
   investigation specialist Spanish (Former Employee) –  Cork, Ireland – 3
   September 2016
   Hello, I see my job advertised exactly one month after they terminated
   employment for me and my colleagues, if you want a temp job (described
   as permanent) this is for you, wages are low, with teh promise of
   shares if you stay 2 years, however they will terminate you prior to
   you ever getting to 2 years because thats what the do churn them in ,
   and spit them out, or burn them out.
   The job investigation specialist is no way as exciting as it appears,
   its nothing more than admin, repetitive with no carreer prospects
   Pros
   work from home days (20 per year)
   Cons
   Monotony, no carreer prospects, no job security

   customer associate role
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cork – 30 August 2016
   Prepared for customer inquiries by studying products, services, and
   customer service processes.
   Responded to customer inquiries by understanding inquiry; reviewing
   previous inquiries and responses; gathering and researching
   information; assembling and forwarding information; verifying
   customer's understanding of information and answer.
   Hardest part was to get to work early because my car was on the garage
   for a few weeks so public transport was an issue.
   my co workers were great and brilliantly adaptive.
   loved their corporate culture as they endeavoured to be really adaptive
   to other cultures
   I learnt a lot of customer service and organisation mission by
   completing related results as needed.

   The people were lovely and working there was fine it was easily managed
   around school and college . Hours were 8 hr shifts , minimum wage was
   the only thing I’d change if I stayed there for longer , a little bit
   more for the job would be better . Overall they are good to work for.

   Ideal for a first or part-time job, but not for a stable career
   Crew Member (Current Employee) –  Clonmel – 18 May 2019
   A typical day at work will see you usually stationed either on lobby,
   counter or kitchen. The work is fairly routine-based with minimalistic
   alterations depending on consumer preferences. High standard of health
   and safety and systems to adhere to.
   Learned skills in customer experience, ensuring a standard of service
   and how to gauge supply.
   Management is friendly and fair. There is a soft level of management
   that enforces the standards of service and behaviour while remaining
   collegial and understanding. Occasional poor selection process of
   managers is the only detraction.
   Low score for income. Sufficient for the type of job (though managers
   are underpaid compared to the work they do), but a minimum wage
   nonetheless. Only sufficing for part-time workers, first job and
   workers who have another income earner at home.
   The hardest parts of the job include:
   - Long opening times and varying rostered hours, though not a 24 hour
   service.
   - Serving an influx of customers with a lower per head count of
   employees, while attempting to maintain standard.
   The most enjoyable parts of the job include:
   - Collegiality amongst employees and management, lead to pleasurable
   work experiences.
   - When going the extra mile and customers are thoroughly satisfied.
   Pros
   Full-time Hours Easily Available, Friendly, Free Lunches
   Cons
   Flexible Hours, Low Wage, Poor Upward Mobility Beyond Management

   Best job ever
   MCDONALD'S CREW MEMBER (Former Employee) –  Dublin – 17 May 2019
   I really enjoyed working there, good crew, flexible shifts, fun
   environment, the managers were so nice and patient, good pay as it was
   a franchisee, obviusly you must be an hard working person because it's
   busy, that's why you can't be bored

   Awful management
   Crew Trainer (Former Employee) –  County Meath – 15 May 2019
   Staff are treated poorly on a daily basis by management. Managers are
   overly aggressive and are allowed get away with it. There is a high
   staff turnover, but the franchisee won't look into why this is
   happening, they don't care about their staff at all, they only care
   about replacing them. There are no staff bonuses at Christmas time,
   nothing to acknowledge hard work, for Christmas all of the staff
   received a box of sweets.
   Pros
   If your interested in working over 40hrs a week this is the place for
   you
   Cons
   Bad management/ and Franchisee

   Nice job for students
   Crew Trainer (Former Employee) –  Dublin – 27 April 2019
   I had a great time working at McDonald's. Its nice place to work as the
   work involved is very hands-on and not so difficult either. You work
   alongside many crews and get a good experience of teamwork and how to
   you can improve it. The timetable is great as in my place I was allowed
   to choose the hours I wanted so great for students as a part-time job.

   Pay isn't great, stressful environment
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Athlone, County Westmeath – 22 March
   2019
   pay starts off at 6.80 for 16s goes up minimum wage after 18s unfair
   considering still doing the same amount of work. Stressful in busy
   periods but would be a nice place to work if the environment wouldn't
   be as negative. When I worked there everyone hated their work.
   Pros
   Free Lunch
   Cons
   Bad wage

   Crew Member (Current Employee) –  Longford – 3 March 2019
   Some days are more enjoyable than others.
   You learn about hard work and working with customers and food.
   Management styles vary from very harsh to fun and fair.
   Workplace is generally fun and friendly but can be toxic at times.
   The hardest part of the job is working understaffed.
   The most enjoyable part of the job is working with friends and nice
   people.
   Pros
   free lunch, sunday pay, bank holiday pay

   great place to work
   Client Support Specialist (Current Employee) –  Dublin – 8 February
   2016
   Indeed is a great place to work - apart from your day-to-day tasks you
   can engage in different groups and projects. It never gets boring. The
   work you do is rewarding - not only because "we help people get jobs",
   but also because management supports you and your career goals and
   there is also a bonus program in place. The various benefits (snacks,
   happy hour, free lunches, events, swag) and a general environment of
   trust and support (unlimited PTO for example) contribute to a generally
   good and relaxed atmosphere at the office. Decisions from the
   leadership and management are mostly transparent. The only downside is
   that you don't get paid for overtime (no flexi time), and that the
   salary in general could be better. The promotion process is a bit
   lengthy and highly depends on how you perform in interviews, less on
   your previous achievements. All in all, Indeed is a great, fast-growing
   company that takes their employees seriously and is constantly striving
   to improve.
   Pros
   health insurance, pension plan, free lunch, events
   Cons
   pay could be better

   Great Place to Work
   Sales Team Lead (Current Employee) –  Dublin – 20 May 2015
   I started here as an account executive in 2013 and have since been
   promoted twice and am now a sales team lead overseeing a successful
   team of high performing sales individuals. As Indeed continues to grow
   there will be more opportunities for successful people here to develop
   and progress.
   The product works and the company ethos is engaging. If you combine
   that with the fun culture of what is still essentially a successful
   tech start-up that is undergoing massive growth, it makes for a very
   cool place to work.
   Pros
   Culture / Work-life balance / Career Progression / Salary and
   Commission/Bonus Potential

   Un groupe en Pleine Transformation
   Responsable Grands Comptes (Former Employee) –  Paris (75) – 10 January
   2019
   Le groupe Actual est un groupe en pleine transformation. Il dispose
   d'une culture d'entreprise forte pour le noyau historique de l'ouest de
   la France.
   C'est un groupe qui dispose d'un réseau remarquable pour l'intérim
   d'insertion A2I et d'un Président visionnaire et accessible Samuel
   TUAL.
   Cependant, le management de proximité est hétérogène ce qui peut rendre
   l'intégration et le développement du collaborateur plus difficile.
