   The following is a script of "Chernobyl" which aired on Nov. 23, 2014.
   Bob Simon is the correspondent. Michael Gavshon and David Levine,
   producers.

   Some tragedies never end. Ask people to name a nuclear disaster and
   most will probably point to Fukushima in Japan three years ago. The
   nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl in Ukraine was 30 years ago, but the
   crisis is still with us today. That's because radiation virtually never
   dies. After the explosion in 1986, the Soviets built a primitive
   sarcophagus, a tomb to cover the stricken reactor. But it wasn't meant
   to last very long and it hasn't. Engineers say there is still enough
   radioactive material in there to cause widespread contamination. For
   the last five years a massive project has been underway to seal the
   reactor permanently. But the undertaking is three quarters of a billion
   dollars short and the completion date has been delayed repeatedly.
   Thirty years later, Chernobyl's crippled reactor still has the power to
   kill.

   It's called the Zone and getting into it is crossing a border into one
   of the most contaminated places on Earth. The 20-mile no man's land was
   evacuated nearly 30 years ago. Drive to the center of the Zone today
   and you'll see a massive structure that appears to rise out of nowhere.
   It's an engineering effort the likes of which the world has never seen.
   With funds from over 40 different countries, 1,400 workers are building
   a giant arch to cover the damaged reactor like a casserole. It will be
   taller than the Statue of Liberty and wider than Yankee Stadium -- the
   largest movable structure on Earth. Nicholas Caille is overseeing the
   arch's construction.

   Bob Simon: You know when you think about it, you have this massive
   project going on. All these people working here. Billions of dollars
   being spent because of one day 30 years ago.

   Nicolas Caille: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. It was the biggest
   disaster of the nuclear industry, yes.
   c0011-new-01.jpg

   The disaster was sparked by massive explosions that tore the roof off
   of Chernobyl's reactor number four, spewing radioactive dust into the
   atmosphere.

   The Soviets drafted over half a million troops to put out the fire and
   clear the nuclear debris. Thousands got seriously ill from radiation
   exposure. Today, three decades later, the cleanup continues.

   But as this recent video shows, the reactor is still packed with
   poison: heaps of gnarled steel and concrete, pools of nuclear fuel that
   have hardened into a dense mass called the "elephant's foot."

   There's still so much radiation coming from the reactor that workers
   have to construct the arch nearly a thousand feet away, shielded by a
   massive concrete wall. When finished, the arch will be slid into place
   around the Sarcophagus, then sealed up.

   Nicolas Caille: We will push it in once, the average speed it will be
   around 10 meters an hour. So it's approximately the speed of a snail.

   Bob Simon: Right. But that's pretty rapid considering the size of this
   thing.

   Nicolas Caille: It is. Yes, yes.

   But the construction itself will have to move a lot quicker. The old
   plant and sarcophagus are falling apart. Just two years ago, a snow
   storm caused the roof of one of the buildings to collapse, forcing
   workers to be evacuated and raising fears of further contamination.

"This was a terrifying picture. It looked like a sunset in the distance,
about 100, 200 yards from you."

   Radiation is not subject to the usual rules of life and death. It is
   virtually eternal. When Caille took us on a tour of the site, we were
   fitted with dosimeters to tell us how much we were being exposed to.
   Suddenly, a sound we didn't want to hear.

   Bob Simon: Hey, there's beepers going off.

   Nicolas Caille: No, no. It's not. It's normal.

   Bob Simon: You're sure?

   Nicolas Caille: Yes, yes, yes. I'm definitively sure.

   Bob Simon: I don't like a beeper in Chernobyl. I don't like that sound.

   Chernobyl’s "invisible" danger

   Building the arch under these conditions is challenging enough. But
   some of the biggest obstacles have nothing to do with radiation. As
   violence gripped Ukraine this year, one of the arch's contractors
   backed out. The project is also 770 million dollars short, and it has
   been plagued by repeated delays.

   No matter when it's completed, vast stretches of the Zone will never
   recover. This is the city of Pripyat, two miles from the reactor.
   Thirty years ago, the population was 50,000. Today it is zero. Pripyat
   was where many of the plant's workers lived, grateful for their posting
   in a town that was the model of Soviet modernity.

   Nine-story apartment buildings lined this boulevard. They're still
   there, but you can't see them anymore. The forest has taken over. A
   vision perhaps of what the whole world might look like were people to
   just disappear.

   It was springtime in Pripyat that day in 1986, and an amusement park
   was due to open in a few days. Andre Glukhov lived here then.
   a014c028130109jj-new-01.jpg

   Bob Simon: So, that Ferris wheel never had any kids in it?

   Andrey Glukhov: Never had any kids. These bumper cars, on your left,
   had never kids on it, too.

   Bob Simon: When you talk to your former neighbors, what do you call it?
   The accident? the catastrophe?

   Andrey Glukhov: We just call it 26, which was the date of the accident.

   Bob Simon: Twenty-six?

   Andrey Glukhov: Twenty-sixth of April.

   Bob Simon: Sort of like the Americans call 9/11?

   Andrey Glukhov: Exactly.

   Back then, Glukhov worked for Chernobyl's nuclear safety division. He
   took us on a tour through a part of the plant that had not been
   destroyed. He was off duty that night, but what he saw when he drove
   past the damaged reactor was like nothing he, or anyone else, had ever
   seen.

   [Andrey Glukhov: This is the control room...]

   Andrey Glukhov: This was a terrifying picture. It looked like a sunset
   in the distance, about 100, 200 yards from you. And this was the
   glowing core of the reactor.

   Bob Simon: That was the first and the only time you saw it?

   Andrey Glukhov: No, that was the first time when I realized the scale
   of the disaster.

   Glukhov told his family in Pripyat to stay inside and close the
   windows. Soviet authorities covered the area with secrecy, told people
   they had nothing to worry about. But 36 hours later, over a thousand
   busses were sent in to evacuate everyone. Authorities told people it
   would only be for three days -- one of many lies. The people never came
   back, and Pripyat is being overwhelmed by the elements. One of the only
   things still recognizable is that old Soviet iconography.

   Radiation at Chernobyl is "a global problem"

   Drive through the Zone, and you'll find that many villages suffered the
   same fate as Pripyat. A row of simple markers has been planted with the
   names of each one.

   But amidst this wilderness, the strangest sight of all. People, just a
   few. Ivan Ivanovitch and his wife Maria were evacuated to an apartment
   block near Kiev after the accident, but couldn't take it. They weren't
   made for the city, so two years later, they came back. Today, there are
   three other people living in this village... just a few miles from the
   old power plant.

"There certainly is evidence that some of the genetic damage that occurs at
the level of the DNA can be transmitted from one generation to the next."

   Bob Simon: When you decided to come back to live here, did anyone tell
   you it was dangerous?

   Ivan Ivanovitch: It's really OK here. You know, when I lived in that
   apartment block, I got sick all the time. But when I came back here, I
   was fine. And I've been fine ever since.

   Bob Simon: You should never leave home.

   Ivan Ivanovitch: I would be long gone if I'd stayed there. I'd be in
   the ground.

   Despite the danger, Tim Mousseau also chose to be here. For the last 15
   years, the University of South Carolina biologist has been studying the
   contamination's impact from a makeshift lab inside the Zone.
   aa055701-new-02.jpg

   Bob Simon: Aren't many serious labs I've seen that look like this.

   Tim Mousseau: Yeah this is an opportunistic lab. It's an old villager's
   house.

   Mousseau's research has shown that the catastrophe continues to take
   its toll.

   Tim Mousseau: And we're going to attempt to measure just how
   radioactive these mice are.

   Bob Simon: What's the comparison between the amounts of radiation a
   mouse would have here and a mouse somewhere else?

   Tim Mousseau: Some of these mice have on the order of 10,000 times more
   radioactivity in their bodies than in clean areas.

   The human toll has been profound as well. Thyroid cancer and leukemia
   affected thousands -- though the exact number of deaths is still being
   debated.

   Tim Mousseau: There certainly is evidence that some of the genetic
   damage that occurs at the level of the DNA can be transmitted from one
   generation to the next.

   Bob Simon: So a nuclear disaster is never over?

   Tim Mousseau: There will be areas that will be contaminated for
   thousands, if not millions, of years.

   This makes the Zone like no other place on Earth, which is why it's
   attracting tourists. If you've done Paris and Rome, why not try a
   holiday in hell. Check out the apocalypse?
   Tourists in Chernobyl.jpg

   Bob Simon: How did your friends react when you told them you were
   coming on vacation to Chernobyl?

   David McHale: They thought it was very strange, you know. But, I mean,
   people have been coming here for a while, so you know, I guess it must
   be safe.

   Bob Simon: You guess it must be safe. What makes you believe it's safe?

   David McHale: Well, you know, I would assume that the guides wouldn't
   bring people here if it wasn't safe.

   Bob Simon: All right, well, I hope you're right.

   David McHale: So do I.

   Thousands of workers flood into the Zone every day, to look after what
   remains of the plant. Others live here year-round, in one of the few
   places safe enough for inhabitants: the town of Chernobyl itself.

   Yevgen Goncharenko was our guide. He lives here too.

   Bob Simon: Why are you living here and not in Kiev?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: Because I like this place. For me and it's very
   interesting maybe even sacred place for me.

   Bob Simon: A sacred place?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: For me, yeah.

   He spends much of his time writing music on his bass guitar. Music as
   desolate as the landscape surrounding him. As desolate as the remains
   of this empire that has long since disappeared.

   A decade after the disaster, workers here built a monument honoring
   their colleagues whose lives had been destroyed.
   aa070601-new-01.jpg

   Bob Simon: The workers and the firemen made the monument themselves?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

   Bob Simon: And what does it say?

   Yevgen Goncharenko: "To those who saved the world."

   Bob Simon: "To those who saved the world."

   That may sound a bit hyperbolic. But when the reactor exploded in 1986,
   radioactive dust and debris were carried as far away as Italy and
   Sweden. Until the arch finally seals up that stricken reactor, and no
   one knows when that might be, something like that could happen again.
   Unlike other historic relics, Chernobyl does not belong to the past;
   its power will never die. Chernobyl is forever.

Maguire: Whistleblower was "not ignored"

   In his opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee,

Why Trump's Ukraine call is "unprecedented"

   Lawmakers will question Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph
   Maguire Thursday about a whistleblower complaint that led to a House
   impeachment inquiry. When that report first crossed Maguire’s desk, he
   would not let Congress see it. The whistleblower is an intelligence
   official who learned about President Trump’s call with the Ukraine
   president "secondhand" from "White House officials" and believed that
   Mr. Trump's request for dirt on Joe Biden amounted to "soliciting a
   foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign finance
   laws." CBS News senior national security analyst Michael Morell joins
   “CBS This Morning” to discuss why Mr. Trump's call with the foreign
   leader is "unprecedented."

Why Trump's Ukraine call is "unprecedented"

   Lawmakers will question Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph
   Maguire Thursday about a whistleblower complaint that led to a House
   impeachment inquiry. When that report first crossed Maguire’s desk, he
   would not let Congress see it. The whistleblower is an intelligence
   official who learned about President Trump’s call with the Ukraine
   president "secondhand" from "White House officials" and believed that
   Mr. Trump's request for dirt on Joe Biden amounted to "soliciting a
   foreign campaign contribution in violation of the campaign finance
   laws." CBS News senior national security analyst Michael Morell joins
   “CBS This Morning” to discuss why Mr. Trump's call with the foreign
   leader is "unprecedented."

How Starbucks covers pricey in vitro fertilization for even its part-time
employees

   For some couples, finding a job that offers benefits to cover
   infertility could be the difference between having kids and not. One in
   eight couples in the United States has trouble getting pregnant and the
   cost of fertility treatments is not cheap.

   You might expect a tech company or big bank to offer coverage for
   treatments like in vitro fertilization, but Starbucks also offers the
   perk – even for part-time baristas.

   Now, some women are taking jobs there, in hopes that becoming a barista
   will get them a baby, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.

   "It was the darkest time of my life. Our marriage really took a hit,"
   said Shannon Iagulli.

   Iagulli and her husband Nic desperately wanted children. But four years
   into their marriage, it seemed Shannon couldn't get pregnant.

   "You go through your life hearing you grow up, you fall in love, you
   get married, you have kids so it doesn't happen, you don't understand.
   Why is my body not doing it," Shannon said. "And that's where Starbucks
   came in."

   Iagulli learned the company offered an unusual benefit: coverage for in
   vitro fertilization. On average, IVF costs $20,000 per cycle, with most
   couples going through two to three rounds before getting pregnant.

   "I mean, you think barista, you think 18-year-old working to go through
   school, not a 27-year-old woman trying to have a baby," Iagulli said.

   Starbucks covers $20,000 for IVF and related medication for all
   eligible employees. That includes part-time baristas who make, on
   average, about $10,000 per year.

   "It's just been part of who we are, that if you work here and you put
   in the time, you're going to get the benefits that make you a full
   partner," said Starbucks executive Lucy Helm. "It is really important
   to everyone and I think it's something that we're all very, very proud
   of. People fall in love with working for our company once they become a
   partner here."

   But business professor Craig Garthwaite, with Northwestern University's
   Kellogg school of Management, says it's not just about making employees
   happy.

   "In the end, Starbucks is a for-profit, publicly traded company.
   They're not doing this out of the goodness of their heart, this is part
   of a cohesive strategy they have for how to attract and retain talent
   and also to advertise to their customers that they are quote unquote 'a
   good company', one that you want to spend a certain amount of money
   buying coffee at when you could get that coffee potentially cheaper
   somewhere else," Garthwaite said.

   Asked if there was a business case for wanting to keep the same people
   other than just being a nice place to work, Helm said, "Absolutely, no
   question that in today's retail world in which fewer people are out and
   about shopping, places have to be a destination. So yeah, of course
   it's a business case for bringing in more customers because they
   increasingly have that connection with who we are and who serves them."

   Not everyone is happy with the company's wages and benefits: thousands
   have signed a petition online started by a barista complaining about
   understaffing and low morale.

   But count Shannon Iagulli among the happiest of Starbucks baristas. IVF
   gave the Iagullis not one baby, but two, who at six weeks old, made
   their first visit to a Starbucks, their mom's workplace.

   What she's going to tell her kids about Starbucks when they're older?

   "They will know that that's how they came about that if it wasn't for
   mommy going to make coffee that they wouldn't be here," Iagulli said.

   Now, she supports other hopeful barista-moms around the country.
   They've even got a Facebook group called -- what else -- Starbucks IVF
   Mommas.

   Starbucks says it doesn't know how many women are doing this.

   For the Iagullis, after insurance, they only ended up paying about
   $2,300 out of pocket.

   After getting pregnant last year, Iagulli left Starbucks for another
   job. Now she says, come this fall, when the twins are a little older,
   she'd like to go back. They need the health benefits for the family,
   plus she and her husband want to have more kids.
