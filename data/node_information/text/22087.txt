Huawei's BusinessPON Private Line Solution Helps China Telecom Shanghai Build
Gigabit Enterprise Private Lines

   Sep 30, 2019
     *

   [Shanghai, China, September 30, 2019] Recently, China Telecom
   (Shanghai) announced that it will adopt Huawei's BusinessPON private
   line solution to build gigabit private lines for small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a latest move to help enterprises to
   go digital and various industries to prosper.

   As a pioneer in global fiber broadband construction, China Telecom
   (Shanghai) has built the first municipal full-fiber network to carry
   individual, home, enterprise, and industrial services over a unified
   platform. Currently, the full-fiber network is providing PON private
   line services for 300,000 SMEs.

   As more enterprises go digital and innovative services emerge, SMEs
   raise higher requirements on private line networks. For example, mobile
   game SMEs need private lines with higher bandwidths to more efficiently
   render images and audio on the cloud and improve user experience; chain
   stores require private lines that are faster and secure for saving
   sales data on the cloud; 3D building design start-ups require private
   lines with higher reliability and upstream rates to support remote
   customer viewing and real-time data synchronization to the cloud (one
   real map can be as large as 200 GB). In addition, SMEs usually have
   limited manpower, and need private lines that are easy to maintain.

   To provide SMEs with optimal private lines, China Telecom (Shanghai)
   and Huawei carried out joint innovation to develop new gigabit PON
   private lines. The BusinessPON private line solution is a key
   achievement of this joint innovation. The solution has the following
   features:
     * Wide coverage and fast connection: Fiber access resources are
       available anywhere, and hot areas are pre-covered. Gateways support
       plug and play, and services and connections can be provisioned for
       SMEs in minutes.
     * High bandwidth and continuous evolution: The solution provides up
       to 10 Gbps symmetric rates, improving the efficiency of uploading
       and downloading ultra-large files tenfold by 10 times.
     * High security and flexible access to the cloud: The secure IPSec
       VPN access and hardware encryption/decryption engine provide
       industry-leading tunnel performance and protect the security of
       enterprise data. Huawei-developed chips and optimization algorithms
       are used to support 3 Gbps VxLAN with one hop to the cloud. The
       forwarding performance is twice of the industry average, enabling
       high-speed cloud storage and access.
     * High reliability and quality assurance: The availability of
       selective enterprise gateways is up to 99.999%. The private lines
       have industry-leading performance in mean time between failures
       (MTBF), and meet carrier-class application requirements.
     * Simplified O&M, all in one: Gateways replace a stack of devices,
       simplifying enterprise networking and reducing IT O&M costs by 30%.

   A senior manager of China Telecom (Shanghai) said: "Huawei's
   BusinessPON private line solution helps us build differentiated private
   line products to meet scenario-based requirements of various SMEs and
   help them go digital. In the future, we will make more intense efforts
   to help various vertical industries go digital, smart, and prosperous
   through innovation."

   Jeffrey Zhou, president of Huawei's Access Network Product Line, said:
   "Enterprise digital transformation brings new opportunities for
   operators to develop the private line service. Huawei will intensify
   technological innovation in the gigabit ultra-broadband era and work
   with China Telecom (Shanghai) to explore the application of 10G PON
   technologies in the home, enterprise, and industry scenarios. Huawei's
   SingleFAN Pro access solution provides home users with premium gigabit
   broadband services, and provides massive SMEs with private lines that
   feature fast connection, high bandwidth, high security, high
   reliability, and simple O&M.

   Up to now, Huawei has signed commercial contracts with more than 30
   operators around the world for gigabit fiber broadband construction.
   The global shipment of 10G PON optical line terminals (OLTs) ports has
   exceeded 1.5 million, helping operators build leading-edge intelligent
   gigabit OptiX networks.

   [Delhi, India, September 29, 2019] Bharti India and Huawei jointly
   started innovation for enhanced MIMO solution of 5G microwave. Bharti
   India then deployed more than 100 hops of enhanced MIMO microwave link
   based on the latest MIMO technology developed by Huawei, which will
   deliver 1Gbps capacity over single 28Mhz spectrum, improving the
   backhaul capacity by four times.

   Adding CA technology to 1Gbps enhanced MIMO link will smoothly upgrade
   it to 2Gbps MIMO link with additional 28Mhz spectrum. This is made
   possible by Huawei’s innovative 5G CA (Carrier Aggregation) ODU’s
   simplified architecture, saving power consumption by 20% and reducing
   tower rental fee by 50% while achieving maximum transmission distance
   of up to 13 km. After half year’s observation, enhanced MIMO link are
   working stably with commercial traffic in Bharti’s live network.

   India Bharti cooperates with Huawei to launch the enhanced MIMO
   solution

   Microwave is the biggest and most important transmission solution for
   Bharti. To enhance leadership in India market, Bharti faces the problem
   of how to significantly improve microwave transmission bandwidth under
   limited frequency resources. To solve this problem, Huawei proposes
   enhanced MIMO solution, which resolves the bandwidth challenges,
   reduces tower space requirement by 50% and increases deployment
   scenario by 30%.

   Bharti implements the largest-scale MIMO deployment around the world.
   Huawei's 5G enhanced MIMO technology has been optimized to reduce the
   Rayleigh distance of LOS (Line of Sight) MIMO. Comparing with standard
   MIMO solution in microwave industry, the antenna installation distance
   is reduced by 70% and multipath interference of long-distance links is
   resolved to ensure MIMO links work stably. Large scale commercial
   deployment of MIMO is possible with Huawei enhanced MIMO solution.

   MIMO technology achieves four times capacity with same spectrum. In
   this way, telecom operator can build 5G ready transport network without
   extra spectrum investment. Huawei’s enhanced MIMO solution can reduce
   the antenna installation distance criteria, simplify MIMO deployment
   and reduce TCO. Perry Yang, President of Microwave Product Line of
   Huawei, said, "Creating value for customers with innovative
   technologies is the survival reason for Huawei microwave. Huawei
   microwave is looking forward to joint innovation with more operators
   for network development."
