   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.

   Following on its stream of commercial successes in the first half of
   the year, Transdev continues to advance in its key markets. In France,
   Transdev has successfully renewed its delegated management contract for
   public urban transportation services in Dunkerque (France), where the
   Group has been operating historically. On the acquisition side,
   Transdev is making further inroads in the Czech Republic and is
   entering the bus market in New Zealand.

   In France, Transdev has been historically operating the public bus
   transportation services in Dunkerque under a delegated management
   contract, which has just been renewed for a new period of five years
   and four months, starting September 2019. The new network, which will
   be starting services on September 2, consists of 18 bus lines ‚Äì
   including the new Line 15 ‚Äì complemented by two night services and two
   Transport on Demand services, as well as a dedicated school bus
   service.

   Since the introduction of free public transportation services in
   Dunkerque in September 2018, and with the increased quality of service
   offered by Transdev STDE, ridership has exceeded 16 million trips
   annually, an increase of some 80% versus 2017. The Dunkerque bus
   network is operated by Transdev using a fleet of 135 buses served by a
   team of 300 drivers, covering some 9.3 million km annually.

   In the Czech Republic, where Transdev had resumed bus services in
   December 2018, the Group has acquired ‚Äò3CSAD Group‚Äô to become the
   fourth largest public bus operator on the Czech market. With this
   acquisition, Transdev has significantly increased its presence in the
   Czech Republic market, with most of the 3CSAD operations located in the
   Moravian-Silesian region representing some 1,100 employees and 410
   buses.

   Transdev Czech Republic now employs some 1,350 people and operates a
   global fleet of circa 600 buses. Transdev expects to continue growing
   in the bus field and ‚Äì on a more long-term perspective ‚Äì expects to
   compete in the regional rail market.

   In New Zealand, where Transdev currently operates commuter train
   services in Auckland and Wellington, Transdev has agreed terms to
   acquire both ‚ÄòHowick and Eastern Buses‚Äô in Auckland, and ‚ÄòMana Coach
   Services‚Äô in Wellington from Souter Investments. The acquisition
   represents Transdev‚Äôs first extension in the New Zealand bus business,
   with the mobility provider currently operating bus services in
   Australia in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. Together, the two
   acquisitions represent a bus fleet of 211 buses with a staff of 346
   dedicated employees in Auckland and Wellington; both businesses also
   providing school and general charter services. The acquisitions,
   subject to regulatory approvals, signify Transdev‚Äôs confidence in the
   public transport sector in New Zealand, as more New Zealanders move
   towards more sustainable forms of transport.

   With the Dunkerque renewal and these three bus acquisitions, along with
   the Sydney light-rail and ferry contracts in Australia, the Bremen
   regional train deal in Germany, the Gothenburg bus deal in Sweden and
   the recent Dublin light rail extension contract in Ireland, Transdev is
   further demonstrating the continued success of its international
   commercial and business development teams.

   Finally, in Sweden, Transdev has announced in late July 2019 the
   acquisition of A Bj√∂rks AB, a major bus operator in Central and
   Northern Sweden. With this move, Transdev has become Sweden‚Äôs third
   largest public transportation operator, with annual revenues of
   approximately ‚Ç¨570 million and over 6,000 employees. The acquisition is
   expected to be completed in September 2019.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.

   Following on its stream of commercial successes in the first half of
   the year, Transdev continues to advance in its key markets. In France,
   Transdev has successfully renewed its delegated management contract for
   public urban transportation services in Dunkerque (France), where the
   Group has been operating historically. On the acquisition side,
   Transdev is making further inroads in the Czech Republic and is
   entering the bus market in New Zealand.

   In France, Transdev has been historically operating the public bus
   transportation services in Dunkerque under a delegated management
   contract, which has just been renewed for a new period of five years
   and four months, starting September 2019. The new network, which will
   be starting services on September 2, consists of 18 bus lines ‚Äì
   including the new Line 15 ‚Äì complemented by two night services and two
   Transport on Demand services, as well as a dedicated school bus
   service.

   Since the introduction of free public transportation services in
   Dunkerque in September 2018, and with the increased quality of service
   offered by Transdev STDE, ridership has exceeded 16 million trips
   annually, an increase of some 80% versus 2017. The Dunkerque bus
   network is operated by Transdev using a fleet of 135 buses served by a
   team of 300 drivers, covering some 9.3 million km annually.

   In the Czech Republic, where Transdev had resumed bus services in
   December 2018, the Group has acquired ‚Äò3CSAD Group‚Äô to become the
   fourth largest public bus operator on the Czech market. With this
   acquisition, Transdev has significantly increased its presence in the
   Czech Republic market, with most of the 3CSAD operations located in the
   Moravian-Silesian region representing some 1,100 employees and 410
   buses.

   Transdev Czech Republic now employs some 1,350 people and operates a
   global fleet of circa 600 buses. Transdev expects to continue growing
   in the bus field and ‚Äì on a more long-term perspective ‚Äì expects to
   compete in the regional rail market.

   In New Zealand, where Transdev currently operates commuter train
   services in Auckland and Wellington, Transdev has agreed terms to
   acquire both ‚ÄòHowick and Eastern Buses‚Äô in Auckland, and ‚ÄòMana Coach
   Services‚Äô in Wellington from Souter Investments. The acquisition
   represents Transdev‚Äôs first extension in the New Zealand bus business,
   with the mobility provider currently operating bus services in
   Australia in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. Together, the two
   acquisitions represent a bus fleet of 211 buses with a staff of 346
   dedicated employees in Auckland and Wellington; both businesses also
   providing school and general charter services. The acquisitions,
   subject to regulatory approvals, signify Transdev‚Äôs confidence in the
   public transport sector in New Zealand, as more New Zealanders move
   towards more sustainable forms of transport.

   With the Dunkerque renewal and these three bus acquisitions, along with
   the Sydney light-rail and ferry contracts in Australia, the Bremen
   regional train deal in Germany, the Gothenburg bus deal in Sweden and
   the recent Dublin light rail extension contract in Ireland, Transdev is
   further demonstrating the continued success of its international
   commercial and business development teams.

   Finally, in Sweden, Transdev has announced in late July 2019 the
   acquisition of A Bj√∂rks AB, a major bus operator in Central and
   Northern Sweden. With this move, Transdev has become Sweden‚Äôs third
   largest public transportation operator, with annual revenues of
   approximately ‚Ç¨570 million and over 6,000 employees. The acquisition is
   expected to be completed in September 2019.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.
