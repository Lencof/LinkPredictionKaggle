   This appendix is normative.

O.1 Introduction

   The following are the feature strings for the ‘requiredFeatures’
   attribute. These same feature strings apply to the hasFeature method
   call that is part of the SVG DOM's support for the DOMImplementation
   interface defined in DOM Level 2 Core [DOM2] (see Feature strings for
   the hasFeature method call). In some cases the feature strings map
   directly to a set of attributes, properties or elements, in others they
   represent some functionality of the user agent (that it is a dynamic
   viewer for example). Note that the format and naming for feature
   strings changed from SVG 1.0 [SVG10] to SVG 1.1. The SVG 1.0 feature
   strings are listed below after the SVG 1.1 feature strings and User
   Agents should support all listed feature strings for compatibility
   reasons. However, the SVG 1.0 feature strings can be considered
   deprecated.

O.2 SVG 1.1 feature strings

   Feature String:
          http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG

   User Agent Supports:
          At least one of the following (all of which are described
          subsequently): "http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG-static",
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG-animation",
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG-dynamic" or
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVGDOM". (Because the
          feature string "http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#SVG" can be
          ambiguous in some circumstances, it is recommended that more
          specific feature strings be used.)

Abstract

   This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the
   publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines
   HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text,
   multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML
   (HTML 3.2 [HTML32] and HTML 2.0 [RFC1866]), HTML 4 supports more
   multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing
   facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with
   disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the
   internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web
   truly World Wide.

   HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO
   8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO8879].

1.1 How the specification is organized

   This specification is divided into the following sections:

   Sections 2 and 3: Introduction to HTML 4
          The introduction describes HTML's place in the scheme of the
          World Wide Web, provides a brief history of the development of
          HTML, highlights what can be done with HTML 4, and provides some
          HTML authoring tips.

          The brief SGML tutorial gives readers some understanding of
          HTML's relationship to SGML and gives summary information on how
          to read the HTML Document Type Definition (DTD).

   Sections 4 - 24: HTML 4 reference manual
          The bulk of the reference manual consists of the HTML language
          reference, which defines all elements and attributes of the
          language.

          This document has been organized by topic rather than by the
          grammar of HTML. Topics are grouped into three categories:
          structure, presentation, and interactivity. Although it is not
          easy to divide HTML constructs perfectly into these three
          categories, the model reflects the HTML Working Group's
          experience that separating a document's structure from its
          presentation produces more effective and maintainable documents.

          The language reference consists of the following information:

          + What characters may appear in an HTML document.
          + Basic data types of an HTML document.
          + Elements that govern the structure of an HTML document,
            including text, lists, tables, links, and included objects,
            images, and applets.
          + Elements that govern the presentation of an HTML document,
            including style sheets, fonts, colors, rules, and other visual
            presentation, and frames for multi-windowed presentations.
          + Elements that govern interactivity with an HTML document,
            including forms for user input and scripts for active
            documents.
          + The SGML formal definition of HTML:
               o The SGML declaration of HTML.
               o Three DTDs: strict, transitional, and frameset.
               o The list of character references.

   Appendixes
          The first appendix contains information about changes from HTML
          3.2 to help authors and implementors with the transition to HTML
          4, and changes from the 18 December 1997 specification. The
          second appendix contains performance and implementation notes,
          and is primarily intended to help implementors create user
          agents for HTML 4.

   References
          A list of normative and informative references.

   Indexes
          Three indexes give readers rapid access to the definition of key
          concepts, elements and attributes.

1.2 Document conventions

   This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
   authors and implementors. We hope the specification will provide
   authors with the tools they need to write efficient, attractive, and
   accessible documents, without over-exposing them to HTML's
   implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they
   need to build conforming user agents.

   The specification may be approached in several ways:
     * Read from beginning to end. The specification begins with a general
       presentation of HTML and becomes more and more technical and
       specific towards the end.
     * Quick access to information. In order to get information about
       syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the online version of
       the specification includes the following features:
         1. Every reference to an element or attribute is linked to its
            definition in the specification. Each element or attribute is
            defined in only one location.
         2. Every page includes links to the indexes, so you never are
            more than two links away from finding the definition of an
            element or attribute.
         3. The front pages of each section of the language reference
            manual extend the initial table of contents with more detail
            about that section.

  1.2.1 Elements and attributes

   Element names are written in uppercase letters (e.g., BODY). Attribute
   names are written in lowercase letters (e.g., lang, onsubmit). Recall
   that in HTML, element and attribute names are case-insensitive; the
   convention is meant to encourage readability.

   Element and attribute names in this document have been marked up and
   may be rendered specially by some user agents.

   Each attribute definition specifies the type of its value. If the type
   allows a small set of possible values, the definition lists the set of
   values, separated by a bar (|).

   After the type information, each attribute definition indicates the
   case-sensitivity of its values, between square brackets ("[]"). See the
   section on case information for details.

  1.2.2 Notes and examples

   Informative notes are emphasized to stand out from surrounding text and
   may be rendered specially by some user agents.

   All examples illustrating deprecated usage are marked as "DEPRECATED
   EXAMPLE". Deprecated examples also include recommended alternate
   solutions. All examples that illustrates illegal usage are clearly
   marked "ILLEGAL EXAMPLE".

   Examples and notes have been marked up and may be rendered specially by
   some user agents.

Abstract

   This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the
   publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines
   HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text,
   multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML
   (HTML 3.2 [HTML32] and HTML 2.0 [RFC1866]), HTML 4 supports more
   multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing
   facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with
   disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the
   internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web
   truly World Wide.

   HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO
   8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO8879].
