The New Wave of Media Consumption: How Group Nine Media Stays on Top

Here’s how Group Nine Media’s brands stand out in a crowded and ever changing

   It’s no secret that today’s media environment has been challenging for
   publishers, as audience attention (and the resulting ad dollars) grows
   ever more elusive.

   Consumer attention and media consumption has shifted dramatically from
   radio, newspapers and television to mobile and social media platforms.
   People want access to news and information wherever they are and
   audiences want to directly engage with content.

   5 Bad Writing Habits You Need to Break Now

   10 Digital Skills Every Media Pro Needs to Master

   Media companies are struggling to adapt to the way that people get
   their hands on everything from hard hitting news to feel good stories.

   However, for some companies, this constant evolution presents more of
   an opportunity than a hurdle—and nobody is better at staying ahead of
   the curve than Group Nine Media.

   Group Nine Media is the parent company of four powerful brands you’ve
   frequently seen in your social media feeds: NowThis (the no. 1 most
   watched U.S. video news creator on social), The Dodo (the no. 1 animal
   brand on social), Thrillist (the most trusted digital brand in food,
   drink, travel, and entertainment) and Seeker (the digital leader in
   science and curiosity).

   Known for its high-quality, timely, and engaging video content—not to
   mention killer social media strategy—Group Nine isn’t intimidated by
   the growing challenge of standing out in the crowded and ever-changing
   landscape—in fact, the company is excited by it.

   “There is a ton of video content currently in users’ Facebook feeds, so
   the name of the game is to get people to stop scrolling and watch our
   videos,” shares Shelby Levinson, Supervising Producer for Publishing
   and Strategy at NowThis.

   So much of Group Nine’s success is driven by its distributed content
   strategy on social media platforms. Within the company, there are
   obviously a lot of roles that fall within the video and social media
   management realm—including platform managers who are tasked with
   intimately understanding the ins and outs of their designated social
   media platforms.

   However, just because Group Nine’s brands live and breathe on social
   doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of other roles and departments that
   contribute to its mission.
   Check out all the amazing opportunities at Group Nine Media

   “Our written editorial team actually works hand-in-hand with our social
   video team,” explains Matt Morales, Producer and Editor with Seeker.
   “Both teams attend the same pitch meeting and work together to make
   sure that they are creating complementary content that shares our
   editorial tone and vision. So, when you’re on Seeker’s website, you can
   not only read a great article on, say, the latest advancements in
   artificial intelligence, but you can also watch a video related to that
   content.”

   Indeed, Group Nine places a great deal of emphasis on cross-functional
   collaboration in order to produce its standout content.

   “In my day-to-day on the social team, I’m consistently working with
   other teams including video, written, business and operations, and
   analytics,” explains Nicole Hendrickson, Senior Social Media Manager
   for The Dodo.

   Group Nine’s teams also work together to incorporate data driven
   insights into their editorial and social publishing strategies to make
   each piece of content as impactful as possible.

   “We’re a social-first publisher, so every single piece of content we
   create is specifically tailored for the platform it’s being published
   to,” Hendrickson adds.

   It’s no secret that Group Nine is forging a new path in the media
   landscape. But, don’t let that intimidate you—when it comes to hiring,
   Group Nine looks for people who are willing to learn and evolve, rather
   than people who have already mastered a specific skill set.

   “It’s important to look for candidates who are open to trying new
   things and willing to dive right into the brand,” says Julie Cerick,
   Director of Operations at Thrillist.

   That flexibility and willingness to experiment carries a lot of weight
   at Group Nine, particularly since the company is ready and willing to
   invest in helping people shake some of those standard beliefs and gain
   a better understanding of their innovative approach to media.

   “When we bring in new employees, a big part of that training is getting
   out of the old habits and learning how to entice people to watch a
   video and keep watching,” adds Levinson.

   With this forward thinking attitude, tackling new challenges, and
   plenty of driven, passionate employees on its constantly growing team,
   Group Nine has a lot of enthusiasm for the future—which is the very
   thing that keeps team members excited to head into the office day in
   and day out. The company is centered on core values: “care deeply,” “be
   brave,” “go first,” do good,” “stay close,” and “win together.” They
   recently hired their first Chief People Officer, Stacy Green who has a
   proven record of building the kinds of environments that allow
   employees to thrive.

   “It’s the idea that anything could change at any moment, which is so
   exciting because it affords me new opportunities to learn,” concludes
   Cerick, “I love being kept on my toes and having to adapt to how the
   world consumes content. It’s changed so much in five years; imagine
   where we’ll be in the next five…”

   Group Nine Media is hiring. Explore all the great open positions.

The New Wave of Media Consumption: How Group Nine Media Stays on Top

   It’s no secret that today’s media environment has been challenging for
   publishers, as audience attention (and the resulting ad dollars) grows
   ever more elusive.

   Consumer attention and media consumption has shifted dramatically from
   radio, newspapers and television to mobile and social media platforms.
   People want access to news and information wherever they are and
   audiences want to directly engage with content.

   10 Digital Skills Every Media Pro Needs to Master

   Media companies are struggling to adapt to the way that people get
   their hands on everything from hard hitting news to feel good stories.

   However, for some companies, this constant evolution presents more of
   an opportunity than a hurdle—and nobody is better at staying ahead of
   the curve than Group Nine Media.

   Group Nine Media is the parent company of four powerful brands you’ve
   frequently seen in your social media feeds: NowThis (the no. 1 most
   watched U.S. video news creator on social), The Dodo (the no. 1 animal
   brand on social), Thrillist (the most trusted digital brand in food,
   drink, travel, and entertainment) and Seeker (the digital leader in
   science and curiosity).

   Known for its high-quality, timely, and engaging video content—not to
   mention killer social media strategy—Group Nine isn’t intimidated by
   the growing challenge of standing out in the crowded and ever-changing
   landscape—in fact, the company is excited by it.

   “There is a ton of video content currently in users’ Facebook feeds, so
   the name of the game is to get people to stop scrolling and watch our
   videos,” shares Shelby Levinson, Supervising Producer for Publishing
   and Strategy at NowThis.

   So much of Group Nine’s success is driven by its distributed content
   strategy on social media platforms. Within the company, there are
   obviously a lot of roles that fall within the video and social media
   management realm—including platform managers who are tasked with
   intimately understanding the ins and outs of their designated social
   media platforms.

   However, just because Group Nine’s brands live and breathe on social
   doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of other roles and departments that
   contribute to its mission.
   Check out all the amazing opportunities at Group Nine Media

   “Our written editorial team actually works hand-in-hand with our social
   video team,” explains Matt Morales, Producer and Editor with Seeker.
   “Both teams attend the same pitch meeting and work together to make
   sure that they are creating complementary content that shares our
   editorial tone and vision. So, when you’re on Seeker’s website, you can
   not only read a great article on, say, the latest advancements in
   artificial intelligence, but you can also watch a video related to that
   content.”

   Indeed, Group Nine places a great deal of emphasis on cross-functional
   collaboration in order to produce its standout content.

   “In my day-to-day on the social team, I’m consistently working with
   other teams including video, written, business and operations, and
   analytics,” explains Nicole Hendrickson, Senior Social Media Manager
   for The Dodo.

   Group Nine’s teams also work together to incorporate data driven
   insights into their editorial and social publishing strategies to make
   each piece of content as impactful as possible.

   “We’re a social-first publisher, so every single piece of content we
   create is specifically tailored for the platform it’s being published
   to,” Hendrickson adds.

   It’s no secret that Group Nine is forging a new path in the media
   landscape. But, don’t let that intimidate you—when it comes to hiring,
   Group Nine looks for people who are willing to learn and evolve, rather
   than people who have already mastered a specific skill set.

   “It’s important to look for candidates who are open to trying new
   things and willing to dive right into the brand,” says Julie Cerick,
   Director of Operations at Thrillist.

   That flexibility and willingness to experiment carries a lot of weight
   at Group Nine, particularly since the company is ready and willing to
   invest in helping people shake some of those standard beliefs and gain
   a better understanding of their innovative approach to media.

   “When we bring in new employees, a big part of that training is getting
   out of the old habits and learning how to entice people to watch a
   video and keep watching,” adds Levinson.

   With this forward thinking attitude, tackling new challenges, and
   plenty of driven, passionate employees on its constantly growing team,
   Group Nine has a lot of enthusiasm for the future—which is the very
   thing that keeps team members excited to head into the office day in
   and day out. The company is centered on core values: “care deeply,” “be
   brave,” “go first,” do good,” “stay close,” and “win together.” They
   recently hired their first Chief People Officer, Stacy Green who has a
   proven record of building the kinds of environments that allow
   employees to thrive.

   “It’s the idea that anything could change at any moment, which is so
   exciting because it affords me new opportunities to learn,” concludes
   Cerick, “I love being kept on my toes and having to adapt to how the
   world consumes content. It’s changed so much in five years; imagine
   where we’ll be in the next five…”

   Group Nine Media is hiring. Explore all the great open positions.
