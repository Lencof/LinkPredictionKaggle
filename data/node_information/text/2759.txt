How this wearable tech startup scored a starring role in Joe Rogan’s Sober
October challenge

Fans can follow how no booze affects the sleep, exercise, and recovery time
of comedians and podcasters Rogan, Tom Segura, Bert Kreischer, and Ari
Shaffir.

   What better way to start Sober October than to talk about your buddy
   dosing you with MDMA?
   advertisement
   advertisement

   That was the one of the opening anecdotes on Joe Rogan’s annual Sober
   October podcast this week, serving as an announcement that for the
   third year in a row, the host and his comic pals would be living clean
   this month.

   The story, as told by Bert Kreischer, involved his friend Ari Shaffir
   spiking his drink. Like all great Kreischer tales, it’s long, detailed,
   hilarious, and definitely not something any timid brand would want to
   be associated with.

   Yet as Sober October evolves into an annual event and excuse for the
   four comedian friends to interact and compete and bust each other’s
   chops, it is now an ideal platform for the brave brand that can
   credibly join the conversation between the performers and their ardent
   fans.

   This year, all four comics are wearing a Whoop strap, and using the
   wearable tech company’s platform to track their progress through Sober
   October while inviting fans to follow along online.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnFAfg4gQDQ?feature=oembed

   Rogan opened the podcast by telling listeners about Whoop, and how it’s
   not just for pro athletes but “even losers like us” to improve their
   recovery, training, sleep, and make better lifestyle choices. “This
   month, I’ll be wearing my Whoop 24/7 to understand the impact of
   sobriety has on my body. LOL,” said Rogan. “I’m a big fan of this
   company. I’m a big fan of the kind of analytics that this Whoop strap
   provides you.”

   All told, it was a two-minute ad on one of the world’s most popular
   podcasts, plus Whoop was worked into the conversation throughout the
   almost three-hour episode.

   Whoop CEO Will Ahmed says partnering with Rogan is a perfect fit for
   his brand. “We’ve been a big fan of Joe Rogan’s for a while now. I
   think he speaks to biohacking and human performance in a lot of
   different contexts, and our mission at Whoop is to unlock human
   performance,” he says.

   Founded in 2011, Whoop has been popular among pro and elite athletes,
   as well as hardcore health nuts for awhile now, but Ahmed says Whoop
   wants to show everyone the benefits of better understanding your body.
   Losers and all. He hopes that aligning Whoop with some of the most
   popular comics in the country is a perfect way to do that. “Joe Rogan
   and his friends have mass-market appeal, and a really wide listener
   base,” says Ahmed. [Rogan has one of the most popular podcasts and
   YouTube shows of any stripe, while Kreischer’s Bertcast, Ari Shaffir’s
   Skeptic Tank, and Segura’s Your Mom’s House are also chart-topping
   comedy podcasts.] “For Whoop, we’ve been generally focused on certain
   markets that are maybe a bit more health and fitness focused. We see
   this as an opportunity to expand our reach and have more people aware
   of the brand. Ultimately, we’ve built technology that can really help
   anyone motivated to improve.”

   [Photo: courtesy of Whoop]Sober October, a tradition that reportedly
   got started about a decade ago in Australia, has gained popularity as
   the new Dry January. Ahmed says it ties directly into the brand’s
   mission, because so much of our body’s strength is derived from how
   well we sleep. “Alcohol has a huge effect on your quality of sleep,” he
   says. “You get way less slow-wave and REM sleep than you normally
   would. REM sleep is when your mind is repairing, and slow-wave sleep is
   when your body produces 95% of its human growth hormone. So this idea
   that you get stronger in the gym is false. You get get stronger when
   your body’s repairing your muscles.”

   On the podcast, Rogan, Segura, Kreischer, and Shaffir spent a lot of
   time sorting out the ground rules for their own month-long quest for
   improvement. Just to be clear, no Molly, no Adderall, and no booze.

   Cigars are okay, though.

   This trippy short film seamlessly combines paintings, live action, and
   stop-motion
   By KC Ifeanyi1 minute Read

   What: The short film The Full Story
   advertisement

   Who: Co-directors/animators Daisy Jacobs and Chris Wilder

   Why we care: Whether it’s a short or a feature film, animation is a
   notoriously laborious process. So what happens when you put
   stop-motion, live action, and paintings in a blender? Something trippy,
   for sure—but also something incredibly challenging. “[We] really wanted
   to push [ourselves] creatively and try new ideas,” Jacobs and Wilder
   told art blog Colossal.

   The Full Story tells the moving tale of a man learning to let go of his
   childhood home that’s riddled with painful memories of death and
   divorce. With that narrative at the center, Jacobs and Wilder used a
   seamless mishmash of media to build out the stunning world around the
   characters.

   “To make the sets more realistic, we emphasized textures and brought
   out shine with lighting and varnish,” they said. “With the real people,
   we did the opposite–painting their clothes, minimizing shadows on their
   faces with makeup, and making them more graphic with wigs.”

   Watch The Full Story below:

These magical books help kids learn other languages

Many parents want their kids to be bilingual but don’t have the tools to
teach them. Enter Habbi Habbi, a platform that makes learning new languages
fun.

   My 3-year-old has been playing in her room by herself for an hour. I’m
   beginning to worry she is up to no good: Is she “decorating” her walls
   with a Sharpie or perhaps systematically pulling out tufts of wool from
   her rug? But I take a peek, and there she is, right where I left her,
   flipping through a bilingual picture book full of Spanish and English
   words created by a new startup called Habbi Habbi.
   advertisement
   advertisement

   The thing that is keeping her captivated is a little “reading wand,”
   complete with a star-shaped top that makes it easier for small children
   to hold and also makes it feel more like a magic wand. And to my
   daughter, the wand really does feel magical. When she points it at the
   book, it says the word. She taps a picture of a mother and the wand
   says, “mommy” then “mamá.” But she’s discovered other little surprises
   hiding in the book. Sometimes, when she taps a random part of the page,
   the wand might play music. She’s transfixed but also learning
   something.
   Anne-Louise Nieto and Hanna Chiou [Photo: Jun An Wang/courtesy Habbi
   Habbi]

   This highly engaging toddler UX was created by Anne-Louise Nieto and
   Hanna Chiou, cofounders of Habbi Habbi. The company launched with
   bilingual books in both Spanish and Mandarin for children aged 1 to 10.
   For each language, there are four books that cover first words, first
   phrases, emotion, and careers. The set costs $85. The wand, which works
   through computer vision, is compatible with any Habbi Habbi book. The
   tip of the wand identifies the pixels on a page, reading out the
   specific word or illustration in question. The company plans to launch
   new languages soon.

   The cofounders met while working as management consultants at the
   Boston Consulting Group, where they specialized in advising companies
   that created consumer products. They both wanted to help their children
   learn languages besides English but couldn’t find many resources for
   people like them, native English speakers who want to introduce their
   kids to other languages. Chiou is from a Chinese family and wanted her
   kids to pick up Mandarin, and Nieto is married to a Spanish speaker but
   isn’t fluent herself. “If parents speak multiple languages fluently,
   they can start teaching their kids the other language when they are
   infants and buy them children’s books in other languages,” Nieto says.
   “But there are many of us who aren’t fluent in another language and
   revert to speaking to our kids in English. We need products that are
   designed to be truly bilingual.”
   [Photo: Habbi Habbi]

   This is something I can relate to. I grew up in Paris and learned
   French as a second language but haven’t lived in a French-speaking
   country for decades. Meanwhile, my husband only speaks English. I have
   tried to teach my daughter French, but it’s hard and we both give up
   quickly.

   This kind of scenario is becoming increasingly common in the United
   States. There has been a 2% rise in bilingual children in the country
   over the past decade, an increase of 1.2 million kids. But there’s a
   lot of variation in terms of what this means. In some cases, kids don’t
   speak English at home: that’s true of 44% of kids in California and 2%
   of kids in West Virginia. Around 4% of children who grow up in
   non-English speaking households, or 2.4 million, have trouble speaking
   English. But there are many other homes where multiple languages are
   spoken simultaneously, or parents simply want their kids to be
   multilingual, since this is associated with better mental flexibility,
   increased cultural competence, stronger family connections, and later
   in life, access to better paying jobs.

   Habbi Habbi’s products are designed for kids across the spectrum of
   language learning and a range of ages. As Nieto and Chiou worked on
   developing these products, they realized that one of the keys to
   success would be to creating the most engaging possible experience for
   kids. This wasn’t easy, particularly since kids are used to being
   hyper-stimulated with screens and digital media. “These books aren’t
   actually that high tech,” says Nieto. “There is no technology embedded
   in the book itself. It’s just the wand that makes the experience
   unique.”
   advertisement

   Before launching the product, the cofounders opened a pop-up in
   Stanford Shopping Center in the heart of Silicon Valley, in a cozy
   living-room like environment. While all the products were for sale, the
   founders were actually creating an elaborate focus group where they
   could see how kids interacted with products. “Our experience as parents
   is that it is relatively easy to capture a kid’s attention for a short
   time, but there are very few toys that keep kid’s interested for a long
   time,” she says.
   [Photo: Bailey Williams/courtesy Habbi Habbi]

   Nieto and Chiou discovered a couple of principles that seemed to keep
   kids engaged for longer. For one thing, kids like feeling empowered and
   like they are mastering a new skill. With these books, kids who don’t
   yet know how to read like to feel like they are “reading” with the
   wand. That was true of my kid. Right now, she needs a parent to read
   her books, but she can spend an afternoon with these books by herself
   tapping the wand on different parts of the page and putting together
   the narrative. The cofounders also found that children like games where
   it feels like there are many more possibilities than meets the eye.
   This is why they’ve included easter eggs throughout the book, where a
   tap of the wand might result in a song or other sound. Kids stay
   focused on the experience because they never know where they might find
   a new surprise.

   And yet, the books are still educational. Nieto and Chiou worked on the
   content of the book themselves, but they also worked with teams of
   language experts to come up with the translations in the book. “There’s
   an art and science to translating,” says Nieto. “Often one English word
   may translate into several words in another language, and vice versa.”
   [Photo: Bailey Williams/courtesy Habbi Habbi]

   While kids of all ages can enjoy all the books, they have increasing
   levels of complexity. The first-words books presents simple images of
   things like animals and colors: Kids who are just learning how to read
   may begin recognizing the words in this book. My daughter, for
   instance, was able to make out simple English words like “bus” or
   “red,” while also hearing their Spanish equivalent. So in some ways,
   the book was also helping her learn how to spell in English.

   Later books in the series present more complex ideas and phrases. The
   one about careers, for instance, features women who are all moms but
   also have exciting careers like “product manager,” “surgeon,”
   “entrepreneur,” and “judge.” (There’s also a stay-at-home mom who is
   described as “Chief Home Officer.”) This book features words like
   “surgical cap” and “breast pump.”

   The books first launched in mid-September and so far, parents have been
   very enthusiastic about them, the cofounders say. They’ve already
   received requests to create books in other languages, like French and
   Hindi. “Some parents have even asked if we can create custom products
   for them,” says Nieto. “Some were so desperate they said they would
   even help with the translation.”
   advertisement

   Nieto and Chiou are planning to expand to other languages shortly, but
   for the time being, they already have new English-Chinese and
   English-Spanish books to add to the list, including “Acts of Kindness”
   to reinforce ideas like forgiveness, listening, and respect, as well as
   “Stories of Grit,” to celebrate immigrant experiences.

   For today’s creative professionals, your online portfolio is arguably
   now more important than your résumé. In our era of peak personal
   branding, professionals are making themselves hyper-visible through the
   use of social media and slick personal website design. More and more,
   networking is taking the place of traditional credentials; as a result,
   people are creating platforms for themselves that turn on the axis of
   connectivity and pleasing aesthetics.

   Koby Ofek, a Tel Aviv-based entrepreneur and former technology
   journalist, noticed this trend and has created a new website that
   speaks to the need for design inspiration when building a brand. Humans
   is like a carefully curated Pinterest board that offers insight into
   what the best personal websites look like, which services are used to
   create them, and the technology necessary to build them. “It started
   with a personal journey to find inspiration to create my place on the
   web. I wanted to raise my profile a bit and was thinking, ‘What would
   be the best way to go about it?ʼ” Ofek says. “It’s hard to decide what
   to show and how. I wanted to see some examples of other people’s work
   before I designed my own project.”

   When it comes time to choose a platform to host and design a website,
   users have options: WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace, just to name a
   few. All of these approaches, coupled with the option to code from the
   ground up, make it overwhelming for people to know which one will best
   suit their needs. For each website covered on the site, you can check
   out the design, technology, platform, color palette, awards given, and
   characteristics of the person who built it. You can also  filter
   through the featured portfolios by color, industry, location, and more.

   The websites seen on Humans were sourced from a huge swath of the
   web—via Twitter accounts belonging to web designers and developers,
   web-design award sites, and social-media platforms dedicated to design.
   His criteria for inclusion wasn’t to only add the best-looking
   websites, but to have a variety of styles, services, and technologies
   to see what’s already out there. There are minimalist websites with
   blank backgrounds, and flashy sites with all the design bells and
   whistles. “It’s up to the community to upvote what’s interesting and
   bubble up the better designs,” Ofek says.

   Ofek launched Humans with 500 websites and has received roughly 1,200
   submissions for inclusion since. Early on, reviews were mostly for
   professionals with some role in building the web—developers, designers,
   illustrators, writers, and so on. But over time, Ofek received requests
   to cover many other types of “offline” professions such as activists,
   hairdressers, authors, baristas, and more. Those categories are all
   coming soon to Humans. In the future, Ofek hopes to incorporate
   additional features to his crowdsourced inspo site. For instance, he
   wants to make it possible for users to view version changes, so they
   can track how a portfolio looked in the past and how it improved as web
   design evolved.

   Since Humans launched about a month ago, Ofek’s been busy curating and
   updating it, so if you’re looking for his personal website online, you
   won’t find it. He’s been so focused on his passion project that he
   hasn’t time to complete his own.

The future of packaging could be as simple as a bar of soap

One designer’s water-soluble vision for replacing all those plastic shampoo
bottles.

   The future of packaging could be as simple as a bar of soap

   Beauty brands are notorious for their elaborate packaging. To stand out
   on crowded shelves, companies design elaborate bottles and tubes; the
   average person uses 11 bottles of shower gel and 10 bottles of shampoo
   a year.

   The majority of these products are packaged in plastic, contributing to
   the 300 million tons produced each year. And because most people don’t
   have recycling containers in their bathrooms, it is easy for these
   plastic containers to end up in the trash. Indeed, only 10% of all
   plastic is recycled. The rest of it ends up in landfills or the ocean,
   where it will sit for 500 years or longer.

   Berlin-based designer Jonna Breitenhuber has a solution. For her
   master’s thesis at the University of Arts, Berlin, she developed a
   bottle made from soap that can effectively serve as packaging for any
   liquid hygiene product on the market—and they are just as visually
   arresting as the best-designed plastic bottles.
   [Photo: courtesy Jonna Breitenhuber]

   These bottles, which she calls SOAPBOTTLE, are made from a traditional
   piece of soap that’s been hollowed out. The interior is lined with a
   water-insoluble layer, which prevents any liquids contained within it
   from dissolving the soap. On the top, there is a reusable metal closure
   to allow you to open the top and pour out your shampoo or shower gel.

   One problem you might encounter is that the soap will become slippery
   when it is in the shower. So Breitenhuber included an area to tie a
   ribbon or strap, making it easier to handle. The SOAPBOTTLE is also
   designed to be used as soap. Over time, it will gradually dissolve, but
   this happens slowly, so you will probably be done with the liquid
   contents within it. “These supposed disadvantages are used as design
   elements,” Breitenhuber explains. “The concept plays with the process
   of dissolution, with the transformation of the object and the
   individuality resulting from these aspects.”

   After a while, you’ll just have little remnants of soap left, which she
   recommends using as hand soap, and it’s entirely biodegradable. So
   unlike plastic, it will not result in any waste.
