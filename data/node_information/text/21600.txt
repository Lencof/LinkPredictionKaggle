Balance Calibration Laboratory

Modane Test Centre has a dedicated building for the balance calibration with
two large calibration test benches, B1 and B3.

   To have more detail on our balance design, manufacturing and equipment
   capabilities, see "Balance design capability" section.

B1 CALIBRATION BENCH

   Individual load components or combinations of six components can be
   calibrated.

   Main characteristics:
     * Capacity 150 kN.
     * Accuracy 1.10^-4.

   This bench is for large force balances, sting balances (more than 50 mm
   diameter) and wall mounted balances.
