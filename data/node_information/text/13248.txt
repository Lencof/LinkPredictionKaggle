   As measured by AIXprt workload on pre-production 10th Gen Intel® Core™
   i7-1065G7 processor vs. 8th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-8565U processor (INT8
   Results). Performance results are based on testing as of May 23, 2019
   and may not reflect all publicly available security updates. See
   configuration disclosure for details. No product can be absolutely
   secure.
   Intel is a sponsor and member of the BenchmarkXPRT Development
   Community, and was the major developer of the XPRT family of
   benchmarks. Principled Technologies is the publisher of the XPRT family
   of benchmarks. You should consult other information and performance
   tests to assist you in fully evaluating your contemplated purchases.

   Nearly 3X Faster: 802.11ax 2x2 160 MHz enables 2402 Mbps maximum
   theoretical data rates, ~3X (2.8X) faster than standard 802.11ac 2x2 80
   MHz (867 Mbps) as documented in IEEE 802.11 wireless standard
   specifications, and require the use of similarly configured 802.11ax
   wireless network routers.
   ^4

   As compared to other PC I/O connection technologies including eSATA,
   USB, and IEEE 1394 Firewire*. Performance will vary depending on the
   specific hardware and software used. Must use a Thunderbolt™-enabled
   device. For more information go
   to https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/io/thunderbolt
   /thunderbolt-technology-developer.html.
   ^5

   Best in Class Wi-Fi 6: Intel® Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) products support optional
   160 MHz channels, enabling the fastest possible theoretical maximum
   speeds (2402 Mbps) for typical 2x2 802.11ax PC Wi-Fi products. Premium
   Intel® Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) products enable 2-4X faster maximum theoretical
   speeds compared standard 2x2 (1201 Mbps) or 1x1 (600 Mbps) 802.11ax PC
   Wi-Fi products, which only support the mandatory requirement of 80 MHz
   channels.
   ^6

   Intel® technologies' features and benefits depend on system
   configuration and may require enabled hardware, software or service
   activation. Performance varies depending on system configuration. No
   product or component can be absolutely secure. Check with your system
   manufacturer or retailer or learn more at https://www.intel.com.

   Altering clock frequency or voltage may damage or reduce the useful
   life of the processor and other system components, and may reduce
   system stability and performance. Product warranties may not apply if
   the processor is operated beyond its specifications. Check with the
   manufacturers of system and components for additional details.

   Benchmark results were obtained prior to implementation of recent
   software patches and firmware updates intended to address exploits
   referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown". Implementation of these
   updates may make these results inapplicable to your device or system.

   Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been
   optimized for performance only on Intel® microprocessors. Performance
   tests, such as SYSmark* and MobileMark*, are measured using specific
   computer systems, components, software, operations and functions. Any
   change to any of those factors may cause the results to vary. You
   should consult other information and performance tests to assist you in
   fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including the performance
   of that product when combined with other products.For more complete
   information visit http://www.intel.com/benchmarks. The benchmark
   results reported above may need to be revised as additional testing is
   conducted. The results depend on the specific platform configurations
   and workloads utilized in the testing, and may not be applicable to any
   particular user’s components, computersystem or workloads. The results
   are not necessarily representative of other benchmarks and other
   benchmark results may show greater or lesser impact from mitigations.
