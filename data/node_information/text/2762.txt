   The development of self-driving cars could spur advancements in
   robotics and cause other ripple effects, potentially benefitting
   society in a variety of ways.

   Autonomous cars as well as robots rely on artificial intelligence,
   image recognition, GPS and processors, among other technologies, notes
   a report from consulting firm McKinsey. Some of the hardware used in
   self-driving cars could find its way into robots, lowering production
   costs and the price for consumers.

   Self-driving cars could also help people grow accustomed to other
   machines, like robots, that can complete tasks without the need for
   human intervention.

   Commonly used parts could allow auto mechanics to fix robots as well,
   said the report, released Thursday. Infrastructure like
   machine-to-machine communication networks could also be shared.

   Many tech companies and car makers‚Äîincluding Google, Intel, Sony, Honda
   and Toyota‚Äîare already developing robots, the report noted. Google, for
   example, has invested extensively in self-driving vehicles and recently
   debuted an autonomous car. Last month Boston Dynamics, a robotics
   company Google bought in 2013, showed its latest robot, a four-legged
   machine that can climb stairs and stay upright when kicked.

   Car companies will define their plans for self-driving vehicles in the
   next two to three years. Over the next two decades, trucks will become
   the first vehicles that drive autonomously on public roads, requiring
   changes in the insurance industry. Insurers will end up covering
   manufacturers for technical failures, McKinsey said.

   The Mercedes-Benz F015 Luxury in Motion concept car can detect
   pedestrians and yield to them with the addred reassurance of a beamed
   safety zone. But what about cars coming the other way?

   Autonomous passenger cars, however, won‚Äôt appear in critical mass on
   public roads until after 2040, the report forecast. So the full range
   of benefits of self-driving cars won‚Äôt occur for most people until
   after that time. For example, by 2050, people will have an extra 50
   minutes in their day. That‚Äôs the amount of time people spend driving
   each day, the McKinsey report noted. Instead, that in-car time could be
   used for work, relaxing or entertainment.

   Also, fewer parking spaces will be necessary since autonomous vehicles
   can park closer together than humans do, the report said. That could
   free up 5.7 billion [b] square meters of parking space in the U.S. by
   2050.

   The U.S. health care system could see benefits from self-driving
   vehicles if they live up to the hype surrounding their safety
   abilities. Car accidents ranked second in accidental causes of death in
   2013, but with more autonomous vehicles on the road auto fatalities
   will drop to ninth place in 2050, McKinsey said. With fewer car
   crashes, the U.S. economy could save between $180 billion and $190
   billion each year.

   The report didn‚Äôt delve into the security and privacy issues
   surrounding computerized and autonomous vehicles. Concerns have been
   raised, for instance, around the ability to hack a car‚Äôs computer
   network.

   People are also worried that they won‚Äôt be able to override the control
   systems of self-driving cars. Last year, Google showed off an
   autonomous car that lacked brakes and a steering wheel. However,
   California law now requires self-driving cars to have features that
   allow people to take control if something goes wrong. Google later said
   it would modify the prototype and add a steering wheel and brakes.

Self-driving car technology could end up in robots

   The development of self-driving cars could spur advancements in
   robotics and cause other ripple effects, potentially benefitting
   society in a variety of ways.

   Autonomous cars as well as robots rely on artificial intelligence,
   image recognition, GPS and processors, among other technologies, notes
   a report from consulting firm McKinsey. Some of the hardware used in
   self-driving cars could find its way into robots, lowering production
   costs and the price for consumers.

   Self-driving cars could also help people grow accustomed to other
   machines, like robots, that can complete tasks without the need for
   human intervention.

   Commonly used parts could allow auto mechanics to fix robots as well,
   said the report, released Thursday. Infrastructure like
   machine-to-machine communication networks could also be shared.

   Many tech companies and car makers‚Äîincluding Google, Intel, Sony, Honda
   and Toyota‚Äîare already developing robots, the report noted. Google, for
   example, has invested extensively in self-driving vehicles and recently
   debuted an autonomous car. Last month Boston Dynamics, a robotics
   company Google bought in 2013, showed its latest robot, a four-legged
   machine that can climb stairs and stay upright when kicked.

   Car companies will define their plans for self-driving vehicles in the
   next two to three years. Over the next two decades, trucks will become
   the first vehicles that drive autonomously on public roads, requiring
   changes in the insurance industry. Insurers will end up covering
   manufacturers for technical failures, McKinsey said.

   The Mercedes-Benz F015 Luxury in Motion concept car can detect
   pedestrians and yield to them with the addred reassurance of a beamed
   safety zone. But what about cars coming the other way?

   Autonomous passenger cars, however, won‚Äôt appear in critical mass on
   public roads until after 2040, the report forecast. So the full range
   of benefits of self-driving cars won‚Äôt occur for most people until
   after that time. For example, by 2050, people will have an extra 50
   minutes in their day. That‚Äôs the amount of time people spend driving
   each day, the McKinsey report noted. Instead, that in-car time could be
   used for work, relaxing or entertainment.

   Also, fewer parking spaces will be necessary since autonomous vehicles
   can park closer together than humans do, the report said. That could
   free up 5.7 billion [b] square meters of parking space in the U.S. by
   2050.

   The U.S. health care system could see benefits from self-driving
   vehicles if they live up to the hype surrounding their safety
   abilities. Car accidents ranked second in accidental causes of death in
   2013, but with more autonomous vehicles on the road auto fatalities
   will drop to ninth place in 2050, McKinsey said. With fewer car
   crashes, the U.S. economy could save between $180 billion and $190
   billion each year.

   The report didn‚Äôt delve into the security and privacy issues
   surrounding computerized and autonomous vehicles. Concerns have been
   raised, for instance, around the ability to hack a car‚Äôs computer
   network.

   People are also worried that they won‚Äôt be able to override the control
   systems of self-driving cars. Last year, Google showed off an
   autonomous car that lacked brakes and a steering wheel. However,
   California law now requires self-driving cars to have features that
   allow people to take control if something goes wrong. Google later said
   it would modify the prototype and add a steering wheel and brakes.

Self-driving car technology could end up in robots
