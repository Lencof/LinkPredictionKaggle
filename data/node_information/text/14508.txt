   Pick A Plan
   Illustration of people looking at art

Start putting your data to work

01

Connect all your contact data

   Bring all your audience data into Mailchimp to start using ready-made
   segments.

02

Organize what you know

   Create your own segments and tags to filter audience data however you
   need to.

03

Understand patterns in your data

   Get to know your audience at a glance with your audience dashboard.

04

Turn audience insights into action

   Set up automated messages to trigger based on specific segments or
   tags.

Get a holistic view of your audience

   Whether you’re starting from scratch with CRM or bringing an existing
   audience into Mailchimp, connecting your store and keeping all your
   contact data in Mailchimp helps you stay organized and improve your
   marketing. Best of all, our audience dashboard will help you get to
   know your audience at a glance, visually showing you segments within
   your audience data that you can send targeted campaigns to with just a
   few clicks.

Organize your contacts however you need to

   With all your contact data in one place, it’s easy to use Mailchimp’s
   segmentation tools to find exactly who you need to talk to. Segments,
   tags, and groups work in slightly different ways to help you create
   your own organizational structure and keep track of everything you
   learn about contacts as you grow.

Get insights about how to talk to your audience

   Mailchimp makes it easy to gain insights about your audience—from a
   bird's eye view or at an individual level. Our growth, engagement, and
   revenue reports will help you discover patterns in audience behavior
   and see what’s working with your marketing. Contact profiles let you
   meet the people behind the numbers, so you can dive in and see what
   actions have led to a purchase, leave notes about individual
   preferences, and more.

Build a personalized experience for every customer

   Once you’ve organized your customer data, you can start using those
   insights to make sure your marketing speaks to individual customers
   across marketing channels. Use Mailchimp’s personalization and
   automation tools to make campaigns feel like a 1-on-1
   conversation—sending the right message at the right moment, and always
   making the right product recommendations.

Smarter marketing starts with knowing your people

   Our audience dashboard gives you the tools you need to understand
   contact data and act on it—all in one place.

Insights you can act on—instantly

   This isn’t your average dashboard. Every section is clickable, so you
   can instantly launch campaigns based on what you learn from your data.
   And when you start every campaign with your contacts’ interests in
   mind, it’s easier to create marketing that matters to your people.

Stay focused on your people as you grow

   Your contact data is one of the most important tools you have as a
   marketer, and when you store it in Mailchimp, your audience dashboard
   will help you understand it holistically. Spot patterns in your data at
   a glance, keep tabs on trends, and always know who you’re talking
   to—even as your audience evolves.

   products, but the data told a different story—and helped them reach new
   customers with more targeted messages.

Pre-built segments you can target with a click

   When you know who you’re talking to, you know what to say. We’ll get
   you started with a few pre-built segments, right in your dashboard.

   If you have a paid account with a connected store and purchase data,
   your audience dashboard will also show an estimate of your customers’
   lifetime value (CLV) and their likelihood to purchase again.

   We use predictive modeling to learn from your purchase data and create
   segments of customers based on how likely they are to purchase from you
   again, and how much they’re likely to spend in your store in the
   future—so you can use these insights to reward VIPs, or bring
   occasional buyers back.

Tags & Custom Fields

Unlock better targeting when you bring custom contact data into Mailchimp

   With all your contact insights organized in Mailchimp, it’s easy to
   send messages that matter.
   Pick A Plan

Organize contacts however you need to with tags

   Tags are customizable labels you create for your contacts based on
   what’s important for you to know. While Mailchimp comes with lots of
   built-in ways to search within your audience data, tags let you add
   insights unique to your needs—then use them to create segments.

   Best of all, they’re completely flexible: easily stay organized when
   you tag multiple contacts on import, or even add tags automatically
   based on the specific landing page they signed up on.

Save time by sending to tags in a click—or even automatically

   Once you start tagging contacts, you’ll see your most commonly used
   tags on your audience dashboard, so you can start sending targeted
   campaigns to these segments with just a few clicks. You can even
   trigger automations based on tags, to instantly follow up with a
   targeted message as soon as a tag is applied.

Let people tell you what they want to hear from you

   By adding customized fields to your Mailchimp signup forms, you can let
   your contacts tell you about their preferences, and organize contacts
   based on specific interest groups within your audience.

   Then you can easily send them targeted messages based on what you find
   out, or even trigger automated messages to people based on their
   selections.

Use your unique insights to drive better segmentation

   As you bring custom insights into Mailchimp, they’ll also be added as
   filtering options for building segments—so you can use a combination of
   tags, custom form fields, and a number of other filters to find exactly
   who you want to talk to as your audience grows.

     "We're using tags to organize our audience depending on what they've
     done and how they interact with us. I’m a marketing department of
     one, so having an easy method to segment our audience is essential."

Add your own customized insights
