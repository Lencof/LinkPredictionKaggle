Another journalist killed in Maharashtra: Sandeep Kothari was waging war
against illegal mining in MP

   India hidden Jun 22, 2015 13:00:32 IST

   A 40-year-old journalist from Madhya Pradesh was allegedly murdered by
   three persons involved in illegal mining who kidnapped him and set him
   ablaze apparently over his refusal to withdraw a court case, police
   said on Sunday.

   The burnt body of Sandeep Kothari, who was abducted from Katangi tehsil
   in Balaghat district two days back, was found dumped in a farm at
   Butibori area in Nagpur on Saturday night, they said. Police have
   arrested three persons in connection with Kothari’s murder,
   sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP) JS Markam told PTI in Balaghat
   on Sunday.

   Police suspect the accused, identified as Rakesh Nasvani, Vishal Dandi
   and Brijesh Duharwal, who hailed from Katangi, had allegedly kidnapped
   Kothari and set him ablaze, Markam said, adding the trio were engaged
   in illegal mining and also running chit fund companies.

   They were pressurising Kothari, who was working as a tehsil
   correspondent for some Jabalpur-based Hindi dailies, to withdraw a case
   of illegal mining he had filed against some persons in a local court.

   Police suspect Kothari was kidnapped and murdered because he refused to
   withdraw the matter. “We are investigating the case from all angles and
   a police team is camping in Nagpur. It will be premature to conclude
   the exact reason behind the kidnapping and killing,” Markam said.

   Kothari was abducted on 19 June night when he was headed towards Umri
   village with his friend on his bike. His bike was hit by a four-wheeler
   and its occupants bundled him inside the vehicle and fled before
   beating up Kothari’s friend Rahandle who was riding pillion, the SDOP
   said. Police have seized the car used for kidnapping Kothari, he added.

Another journalist killed in Maharashtra: Sandeep Kothari was waging war
against illegal mining in MP

   India hidden Jun 22, 2015 13:00:32 IST

   A 40-year-old journalist from Madhya Pradesh was allegedly murdered by
   three persons involved in illegal mining who kidnapped him and set him
   ablaze apparently over his refusal to withdraw a court case, police
   said on Sunday.

   The burnt body of Sandeep Kothari, who was abducted from Katangi tehsil
   in Balaghat district two days back, was found dumped in a farm at
   Butibori area in Nagpur on Saturday night, they said. Police have
   arrested three persons in connection with Kothari’s murder,
   sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP) JS Markam told PTI in Balaghat
   on Sunday.

   Police suspect the accused, identified as Rakesh Nasvani, Vishal Dandi
   and Brijesh Duharwal, who hailed from Katangi, had allegedly kidnapped
   Kothari and set him ablaze, Markam said, adding the trio were engaged
   in illegal mining and also running chit fund companies.

   They were pressurising Kothari, who was working as a tehsil
   correspondent for some Jabalpur-based Hindi dailies, to withdraw a case
   of illegal mining he had filed against some persons in a local court.

   Police suspect Kothari was kidnapped and murdered because he refused to
   withdraw the matter. “We are investigating the case from all angles and
   a police team is camping in Nagpur. It will be premature to conclude
   the exact reason behind the kidnapping and killing,” Markam said.

   Kothari was abducted on 19 June night when he was headed towards Umri
   village with his friend on his bike. His bike was hit by a four-wheeler
   and its occupants bundled him inside the vehicle and fled before
   beating up Kothari’s friend Rahandle who was riding pillion, the SDOP
   said. Police have seized the car used for kidnapping Kothari, he added.
