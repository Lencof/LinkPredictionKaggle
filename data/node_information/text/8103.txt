Title II hasn’t hurt network investment, according to the ISPs themselves

ISPs continue to invest and tell investors that net neutrality hasn't hurt
them.

   Jon Brodkin - May 16, 2017 5:30 pm UTC

   Title II hasn’t hurt network investment, according to the ISPs
   themselves

   The Federal Communications Commission's primary justification for
   eliminating Title II net neutrality rules is that broadband network
   investment has tanked since the rules were implemented two years ago.

   FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has cited a few research reports describing
   declines in capital expenditures, and industry lobbyists have
   repeatedly argued that investment was harmed by the FCC
   classifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the
   Communications Act. But when ISPs talk to their investors, the story is
   completely different.

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai announces plan to eliminate Title II net neutrality rules

   "We found that not a single publicly traded US ISP ever told its
   investors (or the SEC) that Title II negatively impacted its own
   investments specifically," pro-net neutrality advocacy group Free Press
   said in a report issued yesterday.

   The Free Press report also disputes the investment numbers cited by
   Pai, saying that its own analysis shows an increase in network
   investment spending since the 2015 Title II net neutrality order. It
   isn't surprising that people on opposite sides of the issue would come
   to different conclusions on investment data. What can't be disputed is
   the fact that ISPs have given a rosy picture to investors, and the Free
   Press report provides examples of ISPs affirming that Title II hasn't
   hurt them:

     * In December 2015, AT&T’s CEO told investors that the company would
       “deploy more fiber” in 2016 than it did in 2015 and that Title II
       would not impede its future business plans.
     * In December 2016, Comcast’s chief financial officer admitted to
       investors that any concerns it had about reclassification were
       based only on “the fear of what Title II could have meant,
       more than what it actually meant.”
     * That same month, Charter’s CEO told investors, “Title II, it didn’t
       really hurt us; it hasn’t hurt us.”
     * Just a few days after the election, Cablevision and Suddenlink’s
       parent company Altice reaffirmed its plan to deploy FTTH
       [fiber-to-the-home] service to all of its customers and told
       investors that it remained “focused on upgrading our broadband
       networks to drive increases in broadband speeds and better customer
       experience.”

   Despite increasing its own capital investment by 10.2 percent in Q1
   2017, Comcast claimed in a blog post last month that the FCC's
   treatment of broadband providers "harms investment and innovation."

Investment continues

   Publicly traded companies are required to give investors accurate
   financial information, including a description of risk factors involved
   in investing in the company. If Title II imposed significant financial
   burdens on publicly traded Internet providers, the companies should
   have informed investors. Instead, ISPs either haven't mentioned Title
   II in calls with investors or have said the FCC policy hasn't affected
   their investment, according to the Free Press report.

   And ISPs have continued investing in order to expand network capacity.
   Free Press provided many examples that you can read in the full report.
   Here are a few regarding some of the biggest ISPs:

     * Comcast spent $7.6 billion on its cable segment capital
       expenditures during 2016, the most the company has ever invested in
       a single year.
     * Charter Communications is yet another example of an ISP that
       dramatically increased its network investments during the two years
       following the FCC’s Open Internet Order vote... From 2015–2016
       Charter’s pro forma capital investments [including newly acquired
       Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks] topped $14.5 billion,
       a 15 percent increase which came despite hundreds of millions of
       dollars (or more) in synergies that Charter claimed following the
       May 2016 closing of the deal.
     * Verizon’s capital investment total increased during the year
       following the FCC’s adoption of the Open Internet Order (just as
       the company said it would a month before the February 2015 vote).
       And Verizon’s total two-year post-vote capital expenditures were
       3.1 percent higher than they were in the two years preceding the
       vote, even as the company divested its Florida, Texas, and
       California systems to Frontier Communications.

   There has also been an "explosion" in online video competition since
   the imposition of net neutrality rules that prevents ISPs from trying
   to restrict access to sites that compete against their cable TV
   offerings, Free Press wrote.

   AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in a January 2017 earnings call that
   Title II regulation is "suppressive to investment," but appeared to be
   talking about the industry in general rather than AT&T specifically. He
   did not attribute any investment decline at AT&T to Title II. In
   December 2015, Stephenson said the Title II rules were not an
   impediment to AT&T and that "Everything that we’re planning on doing
   fits within those rules."

Pai vs. Free Press

   Pai publicly expressed his disdain for Free Press in the speech in
   which he announced his plan to dismantle net neutrality rules, calling
   it "a spectacularly misnamed Beltway lobbying group" that demands
   government control over the Internet.

   Investment data cited by Pai comes from the USTelecom broadband
   industry lobby group, the conservative Free State Foundation, and
   economist Hal Singer, who found a 5.6 percent decline in capital
   expenditures by 12 big ISPs.

   Free Press notes that USTelecom and Singer excluded the money Sprint
   used on a "new strategy of purchasing smartphones and then leasing them
   to its customers," even though "purchasing equipment to lease is a real
   capital expense, recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting
   Principles ('GAAP')."

   "Sprint risked billions of dollars to purchase and then lease handsets.
   That is a key part of its broadband business strategy, and no different
   than a cable ISP’s purchasing and leasing of modems," Free Press wrote.

   Singer argues that "it is important to ignore Sprint’s capitalization
   of handsets, an accounting change that occurred in the middle of the
   experiment," and notes that Sprint itself "breaks out these
   'investments' separately from network investment." Singer also argues
   that AT&T's investment numbers have declined by an unexpected amount,
   especially when you exclude the company's investments in DirecTV and
   some Mexican cellular properties.

   But AT&T predicted its own spending decline years before the FCC
   considered the use of Title II to enforce net neutrality rules. In
   November 2012, AT&T said it would increase capital expenditures in
   wireless and wireline for three years and return to the previous, lower
   investment levels starting in 2015. By February 2015, AT&T told
   investors that it had "substantially completed" the project.

   "Because AT&T alone accounts for nearly a third of the total ISP
   industry’s investments, any cyclical shift at AT&T can impact the
   aggregate in a manner that swamps the overall actual trend," Free Press
   wrote. But even including AT&T, Free Press said it found a 5 percent
   increase in ISP investment during the two-year period after the net
   neutrality vote and capital increases at 16 of 24 publicly traded ISPs:

   Free Press

   "These increases are due primarily to continued core network expansion
   as well as investments in capital equipment needed to expand lines of
   business that utilize the same network (e.g., customer-premise
   equipment such as modems or IP-based video set-top boxes)," Free Press
   wrote.

   Like the AT&T decline, "any increases or decreases in capital spending
   at each individual firm were clearly explained by each company before,
   during and after the FCC’s Open Internet vote. None of the firms that
   saw declines attributed them to any FCC action," Free Press said. Even
   those ISPs that did spend less "continue[d] to increase
   broadband-network capacity." AT&T, for example, has been providing
   gigabit speeds over fiber to millions of new customer locations, though
   it has also failed to upgrade old copper networks in many less
   profitable areas.

FCC votes on Thursday

   On Thursday this week, Pai's Republican majority is expected to approve
   a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would eliminate the Title II
   classification and eliminate or replace the net neutrality rules. (A
   final vote, after public comment, would occur in the second half of
   this year.) Pai claims that this action will reverse a decline in
   broadband spending and encourage ISPs to bring Internet access to more
   people.

   Don't believe him, Free Press says. "Chairman Pai’s only supposed
   justification for dismantling the FCC’s Title II-based Open Internet
   framework is the utterly false claim that it dampens ISP investments,"
   the group wrote. "He has nothing but phony and nonspecific evidence to
   support his irrational belief, which runs contrary to the stunning
   number of verifiable counterfactuals."

       What's the consequence of telling the leaders of your country that
       Net Neutrality is going to kill infrastructure investment (a very
       big problem!) while at the exact same time telling you investors
       that regardless of what happens with Net Neutrality your
       infrastructure investment plans will not change?
       Are you lying to the Government? The investors? Both?
       It doesn't matter. You're not accountable. No one cares.
       No, they're definitely accountable to investors. They're not
       accountable to the government unless they're breaking laws or
       (demonstrably) lying under oath, though. That's why this
       information is so damning, really - when they're talking to the one
       group they're legally required to be honest with, they make it
       clear that it's not going to harm investment.
       It's also why this information is so utterly useless in terms of
       policy-making. If they were accountable to the government then they
       could be sued, and that could have at least some influence on the
       process. Since they aren't, there's nothing that can be done to
       force this kind of report into the discussion.

       Let me play devils advocate here and suggest Pai might be thinking
       the NN hurts network investment vs. not. I can see the rationale
       behind the statement that: more regulation is more burdensome than
       less regulation...
       Except NN isn't especially burdensome. It's basically "don't do
       this one thing," which most ISPs weren't doing anyway. And it's not
       really tied to network investment at all.
       This is why no ISP has stated that NN negatively impacted their
       network investment. The one major company that did reduce the
       amount of money they invested into their network, AT&T, had already
       planned to reduce prior to the Title II change, and still doesn't
       blame the Title II change.
       Theoretically, NN has cut off possible avenues of additional
       revenue for ISPs, such as charging more for "fast lanes," but we
       shouldn't allow something harmful to both consumers and other
       companies, just because it lets ISPs make more money. The FCC isn't
       there to help ISPs/Teclos/Cable companies make money, but to serve
       the public good.

 Ajit Pai loses in court—judges overturn gutting of tribal broadband program

   A federal appeals court has overturned Ajit Pai's attempt to take
   broadband subsidies away from tribal residents.

   The Pai-led Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 in November
   2017 to make it much harder for tribal residents to obtain a
   $25-per-month Lifeline subsidy that reduces the cost of Internet or
   phone service.

   The change didn't take effect because in August 2018, the US Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the FCC decision
   pending appeal. The same court followed that up on Friday last week
   with a ruling that reversed the FCC decision and remanded the matter
   back to the commission for a new rule-making proceeding.

   FCC stands by decision to raise broadband prices on American Indians

   "[S]ince 2000, low-income consumers living on Tribal lands may receive
   an additional $25 per month for these services through the Tribal
   Lifeline program in recognition of the additional hurdles to affordable
   telecommunications service on Tribal lands," the court's decision
   noted.

   The Pai FCC's 2017 decision would have limited the $25 subsidy to
   "facilities-based" carriers—those that build their own networks—making
   it impossible for tribal residents to use the $25 subsidy to buy
   telecom service from resellers. The move would have dramatically
   limited tribal residents' options for purchasing subsidized service,
   but the FCC claimed it was necessary in order to encourage carriers to
   build their own networks.

   The same FCC decision also would have eliminated the $25 subsidy in
   urban areas, reserving it only for tribal lands in rural areas. The
   court's decision Friday, in response to an appeal filed by tribal
   organizations and small wireless carriers, overturned both of these
   limitations.

   A three-judge panel said the FCC failed to consider that
   facilities-based providers have been leaving the Lifeline program and
   provided no evidence that banning resellers would spur new broadband
   deployment. The FCC also failed to properly consider how eliminating
   the subsidy in urban areas would affect consumers, judges determined.

   The judges wrote:

     For the following reasons, we grant the petitions for review. The
     Commission's adoption of these two limitations was arbitrary and
     capricious by not providing a reasoned explanation for its change of
     policy that is supported by record evidence. In adopting the Tribal
     Facilities Requirement, the Commission's decision evinces no
     consideration of the exodus of facilities-based providers from the
     Tribal Lifeline program. Neither does it point to evidence that
     banning resellers from the Tribal Lifeline program would promote
     network buildout. Nor does it analyze the impact of the facilities
     requirement on Tribal residents who currently rely on wireless
     resellers. Further, the Commission ignored that its decision is a
     fundamental change that adversely affects the access and
     affordability of service for residents of Tribal lands. Similarly,
     in adopting the Tribal Rural Limitation, the Commission's decision
     evinces no consideration of the impact on service access and
     affordability. Its decision does not examine wireless deployment
     data related to services to which most Tribal Lifeline recipients
     subscribe.

   In addition, the FCC "failed to provide an adequate opportunity for
   comment on the proposed limitations," judges wrote.

   Lifeline is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills.
   The $25 subsidy involved in the court case is provided to low-income
   Tribal residents in addition to the typical Lifeline subsidy of $9.25
   per month.

Senator blasts Pai, hails court ruling

   The court's decision was released on the same day of oral arguments in
   the case against the FCC's net neutrality repeal.

   We contacted the FCC today and will update this story if we get a
   response. The FCC could appeal the ruling.

   "This is another example of Chairman Pai pushing his own agenda over
   the obligations he has to the American public. We saw it with net
   neutrality, and we're seeing it with Lifeline," Sen. Brian Schatz
   (D-Hawaii) said in a statement Friday. "He comes in with his mind
   already made up, ignoring the process he is supposed to take to revisit
   rules and programs. This is not what Congress intended, and the court
   is right to overturn the FCC's misguided and unsupported order."

Further Reading

   Ajit Pai’s supporters say he’s gone too far with plan that hurts poor
   people

   Broadband access in tribal areas is worse than the US as a whole, and
   tribal access is likely even worse than previously thought because FCC
   data overstates deployment, according to a September 2018 report by the
   US Government Accountability Office.

   Separately from his tribal Lifeline plan, Pai has proposed kicking
   resellers out of the Lifeline program nationwide, not just in tribal
   areas. This would greatly limit poor people's choices, as more than 70
   percent of wireless phone users who rely on Lifeline subsidies buy
   their plans from resellers.

   But even Pai's usual supporters criticized that proposal, and Friday's
   court ruling could make it harder for Pai to kick resellers out of
   Lifeline entirely.
