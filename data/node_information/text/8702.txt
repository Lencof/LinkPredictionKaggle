Gamer jailed for deadly 'swat' prank that started over $1.50 bet

   ORLANDO, Fla. — A media outlet reports an Arizona man has been
   sentenced to three days in jail after deputies say he falsely told
   guests at a Walt Disney World resort there was an active shooter on the
   property as part of a YouTube stunt.

   Orlando television station WKMG reports that authorities found
   22-year-old Dillion Burch was telling that lie to guests at the
   Contemporary Resort so he could get their reactions for his YouTube
   channel.

   Online court records show that Burch was facing disturbing the peace
   and disorderly intoxication records.

   The television station says Burch pleaded no contest to the charges
   Tuesday and drew the three-day sentence.

   No attorney was listed for him.

   Post

   If you’re a robot stealing somebody’s job, it’s best to stay hidden.

   That’s what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos appears to be thinking, as his
   Seattle-based web giant has contemplated a two-story, automated grocery
   store in which a staff of robots on the floor upstairs grabs and bags
   items for shoppers below.

Amazon plans to build flying warehouse to deploy drones

   Amazon isn’t just planning to fill the skies with drones...

   The ground level of the futuristic prototype — a supermarket-sized
   version of its recently unveiled “Amazon Go” convenience store, with a
   bigger layout that could span anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 square
   feet — would be devoted to goods that shoppers typically like to touch,
   sources briefed on the plans told The Post.

   Those could include as many as 4,000 items, spanning fresh fruits and
   vegetables, eggs, meats and cheeses, and grab-it-and-go stuff like beer
   and wine, the sources said. Pharmacies might also might spring up at
   some of the high-tech locations, as Amazon looks to break into the
   lucrative sector, insiders said.

   But for many, the most striking feature of the bigger stores is that
   they could operate with as few as three employees at a time. Sources
   said the plans call for staff to max out at 10 workers per location
   during any given shift.

   “Amazon will utilize technology to minimize labor,” a source close to
   the situation told The Post.

   Job-cutting technology isn’t new for Amazon, which has increasingly
   used robots to automate its distribution warehouses. More recently, it
   has been pioneering the use of drones to deliver packages instead of
   humans, and even filing patents for unmanned blimps that would serve as
   flying warehouses.

   In the case of Amazon’s automated retail prototype, a half-dozen
   workers could staff an average location. A manager’s duties would
   include signing up customers for the “Amazon Fresh” grocery service.
   Another worker would restock shelves, and still another two would be
   stationed at “drive-thru” windows for customers picking up their
   groceries, fast-food style.

   The last pair would work upstairs, helping the robots bag groceries to
   be sent down to customers on “dumbwaiter”-like conveyors, a source
   said.

   With the bare-bones payroll, the boost to profits could be huge.
   Indeed, the prototype being discussed calls for operating profit
   margins north of 20 percent. That compares with an industry average of
   just 1.7 percent, according to the Food Marketing Institute.

   Labor accounts for the lion’s share of a supermarket’s operating costs.
   In 2015, the industry employed 3.4 million workers nationwide, with an
   average grocery store employing 89 workers to generate annual sales of
   more than $2 million, according to the trade group.

   Amazon’s prototype, meanwhile, doesn’t call for any cashiers. It might,
   however, employ “greeters” that could serve as curbs against
   shoplifting — a key hazard for thinly staffed stores — in addition to
   using high-tech motion sensors to track wayward goods.

   Trademark Office

   “Shoplifting is a touchy subject for Amazon,” the source said, noting
   that Amazon may decide to bar its stores from shoppers who aren’t
   members of its “Prime” and “Prime Fresh” services, which carry annual
   fees.

   “In the view of Amazon, people who can afford Prime memberships aren’t
   likely to shoplift,” the source said. “If someone walks in off the
   street, they’ll be able to access the stores, but they’ll have to sign
   up for a membership which means showing an ID.”

   Elsewhere, the two-story design could boost earnings by slashing
   real-estate costs. The setup could eliminate at least half the aisles
   that account for a supermarket’s sprawl, with robots upstairs picking
   through between 15,000 and 20,000 staple items like breakfast cereal,
   spaghetti sauce, paper towels and soda.

   Sources cautioned that the prototype is still in the early stages, and
   that it hasn’t received a final nod. Reached Sunday, Amazon officials
   denied the company was planning a robot-driven supermarket chain.

   “As we’ve said previously, it’s not correct,” an Amazon spokesman told
   The Post. “We have no plans to build such a store.”

   In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon envisions
   opening as many as 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores across various
   formats — a number the company disputed.

   Nevertheless, a source said the 2,000-store, nationwide goal has been a
   real one inside the company, with execs eyeing a gradual rollout to
   gauge demand for the new concepts. A larger-prototype store could open
   as soon as late 2017, according to the source.

Amazon introduces next major job killer to face Americans

   Amazon on Monday unveiled the latest plan to automate American...
   The plans have already been telegraphed by Amazon consultant Brittain
   Ladd in a published paper, “A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,”
   according to a source close to the company.

   The smaller Amazon Go format, which spans just 1,800 square feet, has
   been opened at a single location in Seattle.

   As with Amazon Go, customers at the larger stores — targeted for the
   suburbs — could use an app on their phones to track items they’ve
   picked off shelves for purchase, with the app automatically recording
   what they’ve grabbed with the help of electronic sensors, sources said.

   “The products stocked within the store will be retrieved by an
   automated storage/retrieval system that I designed,” Ladd says in the
   paper.

   “Based on my analysis, I was able to achieve margins of between 22
   percent to 40 percent depending on the size and configuration of the
   multi-format store design and merchandising assortment. Such margins
   are unheard of even in the best-managed grocery retailers operating
   today,” Ladd wrote.

   The bird is clearly the word for the ringleader of a crew of strippers
   that drugged wealthy clients and racked up huge bills on their credit
   cards.

   Samantha Barbash, 43, flipped off a Post photographer after pleading
   guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny in exchange for five
   years probation.

   Justice Bonnie Wittner asked if she had anything to say. “I’m glad this
   is done,” she answered, wearing a black leather jacket, stilettos and
   waist-length blond extensions.

   Barbash was the last of her glamorous cohorts to be sentenced.

   Roselyn Keo, 33, also got a lenient deal. She copped to grand larceny
   and attempted assault in exchange for no jail time in March 2016, said
   the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor.

   Former Scores “massage” girl Karina Pascucci, 29, and Marsi Rosen, 31,
   were sentenced to weekends in jail for four months and five years’
   probation in January 2016. The two pleaded guilty to conspiracy, grand
   larceny and other raps as part of their agreement with prosecutors.

   The brunette temptresses trolled for their marks at fancy hotel bars
   then drugged their drinks, officials said.

   The half-conscious men were taken to strip clubs and separated from
   their credit cards, which the voluptuous vixens used to make thousands
   in charges for liquor and lap dances.

   The scheme was uncovered when Dr. Zyad Younan reported the scam to
   authorities. Pascucci lured him to Scores in 2013, drugged him and
   racked up $135,000 worth of charges on his credit card.

Shareholders to vote on New Media-Gannett merger in November

   Sports Illustrated’s media operations are getting a new operator.

   Authentic Brands Group — a licensing firm headed by Jamie Salter that
   acquired the venerable brand late last month from Meredith Corp. for
   $110 million — has turned around and licensed SI’s print and digital
   publishing rights to The Maven, a small publicly traded startup.

   Under the original sale agreement announced on May 27, Meredith was
   going to continue publishing the print and digital media under a
   two-year licensing deal. Sources said the deal required Meredith to pay
   between $10 million to $15 million a year to ABG for the publishing
   rights.

   Under terms of the latest deal, revealed in an SEC filing on Monday,
   The Maven has prepaid $45 million to ABG against future royalties under
   a 10-year licensing agreement with guaranteed yearly minimum royalty
   payments.

   “Meredith only had a short-term license deal,” ABG Chief Executive
   Jamie Salter told The Post. “Now, we have a long-term partner.”

   The license includes rights to the print version of Sports
   Illustrated—which appears every other week—as well as the annual SI
   Swimsuit issue and SI for Kids and the related digital properties.

   Ross Levinsohn, most recently CEO of Tribune Interactive, a part of
   Tribune Publishing which owns the Chicago Tribune and the New York
   Daily News, will be joining The Maven as the CEO of the Sports
   Illustrated media line.

   Headed by digital entrepreneur Jim Heckman, The Maven has lately been
   on the prowl for acquisitions. Only last week, it purchased Jim
   Cramer’s financial news site The Street for $16.5 million.

   And last month, The Maven had been backing retired NBA star Junior
   Bridgeman’s bid to buy Sports Illustrated, but lost out on its chance
   to take over the whole operation when Bridgeman himself could not
   produce his portion of the financing to close the deal, sources said.
   ABG swooped in at the eleventh hour to land the deal instead.

   Levinsohn and Heckman had partnered on a number of media ventures in
   the past including at Yahoo where Levinsohn was an acting CEO and
   Heckman was an SVP in charge of media strategy and at Fox Interactive,
   where Levinsohn was president. [At the time, Fox was part of News Corp.
   which is the parent company of the NY Post]

   In a statement, Meredith said the deal will allow it to “devote full
   resources and management attention to maximizing the profitability of
   the rest of its portfolio of leading media brands,” which include
   People, Entertainment Weekly, Food + Wine and Travel + Leisure and
   Martha Stewart Living.

   Maven and ABG are pursuing discussions with Meredith for it to continue
   to operate certain aspects of the business, including print operations.
   However, Monday’s deal is not contingent on reaching such an agreement
   with Meredith, according to the SEC filing.

   Under the deal, ABG also gets stock warrants in the fledgling Maven
   company.

   Meredith appears to be sanguine about losing the publishing rights and
   said it only hung onto the publishing operation initially to speed
   along the much-delayed selloff process.

   “As a result of ABG’s decision to license the Sports Illustrated media
   assets to a third party — which was ABG’s right under the contract —
   Meredith’s goal of a completed transaction is achieved.”

   Still, Meredith is not entirely clear of SI. It is still shopping the
   blog site Fansided, which was added to SI when it still part of Time
   Inc. but which was left out of the May 27 deal between ABG and
   Meredith.

   Newsday is selling its freebie commuter paper amNewYork, relinquishing
   its last toehold in the five boroughs as it concentrates on its core
   Long Island audience.

   The sale to Schneps Media, a growing publisher of weekly newspapers and
   magazines in the New York area, is effective Oct. 11. Terms were not
   disclosed, but according to one source amNewYork was estimated to be
   losing about $5 million a year.

   Schneps, which was started by chairman and co-publisher Vicky
   Schneps-Yunis, started with the Queens Courier in 1985 and now
   publishes 33 weekly newspapers and 28 niche magazines across the metro
   area.

   Schneps has been on a shopping spree. In December, it purchased New
   York Family from Manhattan Media, and in September 2018 it purchased
   the Community News Group from the husband-and-wife team of Les and
   Jennifer Goodstein.

   It 2017, it purchased the weekly Long Island Press from Morey
   Publishing, which relaunched the long-defunct daily as a weekly.

   amNewYork was launched by Russel Pergament in 2003 and was aimed
   primarily at giving rail and subway commuters a quick, free read. But
   the retrenchment of retail cutting into its ad base and the
   connectivity of mobile phones on subway and commuter rail lines meant
   less reason to pick up a newspaper.

   It appears the new owner plans to keep it going.

   “We are looking forward to enhancing amNewYork’s brand through our
   expertise in multi-platform media including print, digital, events,
   social media and broadcasting platforms,” said Joshua Schneps, Schneps
   Media co-publisher and CEO.

   Debby Krenek, publisher of the Newsday Media Group — now a privately
   owned entity controlled by Patrick Dolan — said that the company will
   double down on its focus on Long Island as it pushes beyond print.

   “Moving forward, Newsday Media Group will fully focus on serving Long
   Islanders with news, information and experiences as we continue to
   expand our multimedia products and platforms and fulfill our mission of
   being the primary source of powerful local journalism as ‘Your Eye on
   LI’,” Krenek said.

   Newsday farmed out its printing to a New York Times plant in College
   Point and recently moved from its longtime headquarters on a former
   pasture in Melville into a new facility in an office park at 6
   Corporate Center Drive, also in Melville.

Gamer jailed for deadly 'swat' prank that started over $1.50 bet

   ORLANDO, Fla. — A media outlet reports an Arizona man has been
   sentenced to three days in jail after deputies say he falsely told
   guests at a Walt Disney World resort there was an active shooter on the
   property as part of a YouTube stunt.

   Orlando television station WKMG reports that authorities found
   22-year-old Dillion Burch was telling that lie to guests at the
   Contemporary Resort so he could get their reactions for his YouTube
   channel.

   Online court records show that Burch was facing disturbing the peace
   and disorderly intoxication records.

   The television station says Burch pleaded no contest to the charges
   Tuesday and drew the three-day sentence.

   No attorney was listed for him.

   Post

   If you’re a robot stealing somebody’s job, it’s best to stay hidden.

   That’s what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos appears to be thinking, as his
   Seattle-based web giant has contemplated a two-story, automated grocery
   store in which a staff of robots on the floor upstairs grabs and bags
   items for shoppers below.

Amazon plans to build flying warehouse to deploy drones

   Amazon isn’t just planning to fill the skies with drones...

   The ground level of the futuristic prototype — a supermarket-sized
   version of its recently unveiled “Amazon Go” convenience store, with a
   bigger layout that could span anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 square
   feet — would be devoted to goods that shoppers typically like to touch,
   sources briefed on the plans told The Post.

   Those could include as many as 4,000 items, spanning fresh fruits and
   vegetables, eggs, meats and cheeses, and grab-it-and-go stuff like beer
   and wine, the sources said. Pharmacies might also might spring up at
   some of the high-tech locations, as Amazon looks to break into the
   lucrative sector, insiders said.

   But for many, the most striking feature of the bigger stores is that
   they could operate with as few as three employees at a time. Sources
   said the plans call for staff to max out at 10 workers per location
   during any given shift.

   “Amazon will utilize technology to minimize labor,” a source close to
   the situation told The Post.

   Job-cutting technology isn’t new for Amazon, which has increasingly
   used robots to automate its distribution warehouses. More recently, it
   has been pioneering the use of drones to deliver packages instead of
   humans, and even filing patents for unmanned blimps that would serve as
   flying warehouses.

   In the case of Amazon’s automated retail prototype, a half-dozen
   workers could staff an average location. A manager’s duties would
   include signing up customers for the “Amazon Fresh” grocery service.
   Another worker would restock shelves, and still another two would be
   stationed at “drive-thru” windows for customers picking up their
   groceries, fast-food style.

   The last pair would work upstairs, helping the robots bag groceries to
   be sent down to customers on “dumbwaiter”-like conveyors, a source
   said.

   With the bare-bones payroll, the boost to profits could be huge.
   Indeed, the prototype being discussed calls for operating profit
   margins north of 20 percent. That compares with an industry average of
   just 1.7 percent, according to the Food Marketing Institute.

   Labor accounts for the lion’s share of a supermarket’s operating costs.
   In 2015, the industry employed 3.4 million workers nationwide, with an
   average grocery store employing 89 workers to generate annual sales of
   more than $2 million, according to the trade group.

   Amazon’s prototype, meanwhile, doesn’t call for any cashiers. It might,
   however, employ “greeters” that could serve as curbs against
   shoplifting — a key hazard for thinly staffed stores — in addition to
   using high-tech motion sensors to track wayward goods.

   Trademark Office

   “Shoplifting is a touchy subject for Amazon,” the source said, noting
   that Amazon may decide to bar its stores from shoppers who aren’t
   members of its “Prime” and “Prime Fresh” services, which carry annual
   fees.

   “In the view of Amazon, people who can afford Prime memberships aren’t
   likely to shoplift,” the source said. “If someone walks in off the
   street, they’ll be able to access the stores, but they’ll have to sign
   up for a membership which means showing an ID.”

   Elsewhere, the two-story design could boost earnings by slashing
   real-estate costs. The setup could eliminate at least half the aisles
   that account for a supermarket’s sprawl, with robots upstairs picking
   through between 15,000 and 20,000 staple items like breakfast cereal,
   spaghetti sauce, paper towels and soda.

   Sources cautioned that the prototype is still in the early stages, and
   that it hasn’t received a final nod. Reached Sunday, Amazon officials
   denied the company was planning a robot-driven supermarket chain.

   “As we’ve said previously, it’s not correct,” an Amazon spokesman told
   The Post. “We have no plans to build such a store.”

   In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon envisions
   opening as many as 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores across various
   formats — a number the company disputed.

   Nevertheless, a source said the 2,000-store, nationwide goal has been a
   real one inside the company, with execs eyeing a gradual rollout to
   gauge demand for the new concepts. A larger-prototype store could open
   as soon as late 2017, according to the source.

Amazon introduces next major job killer to face Americans

   Amazon on Monday unveiled the latest plan to automate American...
   The plans have already been telegraphed by Amazon consultant Brittain
   Ladd in a published paper, “A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths,”
   according to a source close to the company.

   The smaller Amazon Go format, which spans just 1,800 square feet, has
   been opened at a single location in Seattle.

   As with Amazon Go, customers at the larger stores — targeted for the
   suburbs — could use an app on their phones to track items they’ve
   picked off shelves for purchase, with the app automatically recording
   what they’ve grabbed with the help of electronic sensors, sources said.

   “The products stocked within the store will be retrieved by an
   automated storage/retrieval system that I designed,” Ladd says in the
   paper.

   “Based on my analysis, I was able to achieve margins of between 22
   percent to 40 percent depending on the size and configuration of the
   multi-format store design and merchandising assortment. Such margins
   are unheard of even in the best-managed grocery retailers operating
   today,” Ladd wrote.

   The bird is clearly the word for the ringleader of a crew of strippers
   that drugged wealthy clients and racked up huge bills on their credit
   cards.

   Samantha Barbash, 43, flipped off a Post photographer after pleading
   guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny in exchange for five
   years probation.

   Justice Bonnie Wittner asked if she had anything to say. “I’m glad this
   is done,” she answered, wearing a black leather jacket, stilettos and
   waist-length blond extensions.

   Barbash was the last of her glamorous cohorts to be sentenced.

   Roselyn Keo, 33, also got a lenient deal. She copped to grand larceny
   and attempted assault in exchange for no jail time in March 2016, said
   the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor.

   Former Scores “massage” girl Karina Pascucci, 29, and Marsi Rosen, 31,
   were sentenced to weekends in jail for four months and five years’
   probation in January 2016. The two pleaded guilty to conspiracy, grand
   larceny and other raps as part of their agreement with prosecutors.

   The brunette temptresses trolled for their marks at fancy hotel bars
   then drugged their drinks, officials said.

   The half-conscious men were taken to strip clubs and separated from
   their credit cards, which the voluptuous vixens used to make thousands
   in charges for liquor and lap dances.

   The scheme was uncovered when Dr. Zyad Younan reported the scam to
   authorities. Pascucci lured him to Scores in 2013, drugged him and
   racked up $135,000 worth of charges on his credit card.

   Sports Illustrated’s media operations are getting a new operator.

   Authentic Brands Group — a licensing firm headed by Jamie Salter that
   acquired the venerable brand late last month from Meredith Corp. for
   $110 million — has turned around and licensed SI’s print and digital
   publishing rights to The Maven, a small publicly traded startup.

   Under the original sale agreement announced on May 27, Meredith was
   going to continue publishing the print and digital media under a
   two-year licensing deal. Sources said the deal required Meredith to pay
   between $10 million to $15 million a year to ABG for the publishing
   rights.

   Under terms of the latest deal, revealed in an SEC filing on Monday,
   The Maven has prepaid $45 million to ABG against future royalties under
   a 10-year licensing agreement with guaranteed yearly minimum royalty
   payments.

   “Meredith only had a short-term license deal,” ABG Chief Executive
   Jamie Salter told The Post. “Now, we have a long-term partner.”

   The license includes rights to the print version of Sports
   Illustrated—which appears every other week—as well as the annual SI
   Swimsuit issue and SI for Kids and the related digital properties.

   Ross Levinsohn, most recently CEO of Tribune Interactive, a part of
   Tribune Publishing which owns the Chicago Tribune and the New York
   Daily News, will be joining The Maven as the CEO of the Sports
   Illustrated media line.

   Headed by digital entrepreneur Jim Heckman, The Maven has lately been
   on the prowl for acquisitions. Only last week, it purchased Jim
   Cramer’s financial news site The Street for $16.5 million.

   And last month, The Maven had been backing retired NBA star Junior
   Bridgeman’s bid to buy Sports Illustrated, but lost out on its chance
   to take over the whole operation when Bridgeman himself could not
   produce his portion of the financing to close the deal, sources said.
   ABG swooped in at the eleventh hour to land the deal instead.

   Levinsohn and Heckman had partnered on a number of media ventures in
   the past including at Yahoo where Levinsohn was an acting CEO and
   Heckman was an SVP in charge of media strategy and at Fox Interactive,
   where Levinsohn was president. [At the time, Fox was part of News Corp.
   which is the parent company of the NY Post]

   In a statement, Meredith said the deal will allow it to “devote full
   resources and management attention to maximizing the profitability of
   the rest of its portfolio of leading media brands,” which include
   People, Entertainment Weekly, Food + Wine and Travel + Leisure and
   Martha Stewart Living.

   Maven and ABG are pursuing discussions with Meredith for it to continue
   to operate certain aspects of the business, including print operations.
   However, Monday’s deal is not contingent on reaching such an agreement
   with Meredith, according to the SEC filing.

   Under the deal, ABG also gets stock warrants in the fledgling Maven
   company.

   Meredith appears to be sanguine about losing the publishing rights and
   said it only hung onto the publishing operation initially to speed
   along the much-delayed selloff process.

   “As a result of ABG’s decision to license the Sports Illustrated media
   assets to a third party — which was ABG’s right under the contract —
   Meredith’s goal of a completed transaction is achieved.”

   Still, Meredith is not entirely clear of SI. It is still shopping the
   blog site Fansided, which was added to SI when it still part of Time
   Inc. but which was left out of the May 27 deal between ABG and
   Meredith.

   Newsday is selling its freebie commuter paper amNewYork, relinquishing
   its last toehold in the five boroughs as it concentrates on its core
   Long Island audience.

   The sale to Schneps Media, a growing publisher of weekly newspapers and
   magazines in the New York area, is effective Oct. 11. Terms were not
   disclosed, but according to one source amNewYork was estimated to be
   losing about $5 million a year.

   Schneps, which was started by chairman and co-publisher Vicky
   Schneps-Yunis, started with the Queens Courier in 1985 and now
   publishes 33 weekly newspapers and 28 niche magazines across the metro
   area.

   Schneps has been on a shopping spree. In December, it purchased New
   York Family from Manhattan Media, and in September 2018 it purchased
   the Community News Group from the husband-and-wife team of Les and
   Jennifer Goodstein.

   It 2017, it purchased the weekly Long Island Press from Morey
   Publishing, which relaunched the long-defunct daily as a weekly.

   amNewYork was launched by Russel Pergament in 2003 and was aimed
   primarily at giving rail and subway commuters a quick, free read. But
   the retrenchment of retail cutting into its ad base and the
   connectivity of mobile phones on subway and commuter rail lines meant
   less reason to pick up a newspaper.

   It appears the new owner plans to keep it going.

   “We are looking forward to enhancing amNewYork’s brand through our
   expertise in multi-platform media including print, digital, events,
   social media and broadcasting platforms,” said Joshua Schneps, Schneps
   Media co-publisher and CEO.

   Debby Krenek, publisher of the Newsday Media Group — now a privately
   owned entity controlled by Patrick Dolan — said that the company will
   double down on its focus on Long Island as it pushes beyond print.

   “Moving forward, Newsday Media Group will fully focus on serving Long
   Islanders with news, information and experiences as we continue to
   expand our multimedia products and platforms and fulfill our mission of
   being the primary source of powerful local journalism as ‘Your Eye on
   LI’,” Krenek said.

   Newsday farmed out its printing to a New York Times plant in College
   Point and recently moved from its longtime headquarters on a former
   pasture in Melville into a new facility in an office park at 6
   Corporate Center Drive, also in Melville.
