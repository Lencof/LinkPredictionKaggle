   Goose Game

   Untitled Goose Game effectively ended for me when I found the boy who
   would run away if you honked at him. I didn’t need to achieve any more
   goals. I had reached peak goose.

   The game was released last Friday on PC and Switch. I rarely play games
   and I was not good at this one. But as a birdwatcher (or more
   accurately, a birder), I was absolutely thrilled at the chance of
   controlling a bird who does bird things. I love being the goose.

   I also like learning about birds and going outside to identify birds
   and talking about birds with other birders. I cherish this hobby and am
   somewhat obsessive about it because it’s the only escape I’ve found
   from 21st century-induced stress.

   Video games typically stress me out because I’m bad at nearly all of
   them and I don’t like being bad at things. But when I heard there was a
   game where I could simply be a goose, I knew I had to play. I could be
   good at being a goose.

   Untitled Goose Game from House House was the subject of considerable
   hype prior to its release, for good reason: You’re a cantankerous goose
   and it’s your job to sneak around and manipulate the environment in
   order to ruin the non-player characters’ days. It’s among the first
   video games I can think of that has received considerable attention
   across my own social media circles, on which I engage with mostly
   bird-related content.

   But first, I had to figure out what kind of goose I was. There aren’t a
   lot of large all-white geese with pink bills. I figured it was either
   the North American Snow Goose or the domesticated form of the Greylag
   Goose. The shape of the animal and its particular association with
   humans made it clear I would be piloting the latter. The game doesn’t
   have many other natural features, but I was happy to see cattails on
   the side of the pond.

   I booted up the game, learned to navigate, pick up things, and honk,
   and I was off to be a goose.

   To be honest, I was about as bad at this game as I am at every other
   game, which was frustrating. The first few tasks—stealing keys from the
   groundskeeper or getting him wet—were easy enough. But after around
   thirty minutes of shuffling things around, I couldn’t figure out how to
   get the groundskeeper to put on his sun hat. Plus, the awkward
   controls—specifically the running mechanism (it’s harder to turn if
   you’re running)—meant that piloting my feathered form took more effort
   than I was willing to put into the game. I decided that I’d use a
   walkthrough whenever I got stuck and simply focus on manifesting my
   gooseness.

   And the game definitely delivered on that front. The waddling, honking,
   and flapping all seemed properly goose-like to me. I don’t have a lot
   of experience with greylag geese but from my experience with North
   America’s Canada geese, I would say that yes, geese (especially feral
   geese) can be territorial and fearless animals. I have been hissed and
   honked at by them and even attacked for getting too close. I felt the
   game shined most during moments when I didn’t have to hide my
   goosehood, when the non-player characters noticed me, feared me, and
   even applauded me.

   But geese, even domestic geese, do more than annoy humans. They’re
   monogamous animals that start families, they must survive deadly
   threats, and wild geese are often migrants. These are all fine avenues
   for Untitled Goose Game 2 to explore.

   Other people can tell you whether the game was actually good or not.
   But me, I was just happy that I got to be a goose this weekend.

Apple's Call-Blocking Feature May Be a Little Too Good

   Be a Little Too Good
   Photo: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo)

   Apple’s iOS 13 release is crammed with features we’ve been looking
   forward to getting our hands on for months—I’m looking at you, Arcade
   and system-wide Dark Mode—but one of the tools that this blogger was
   most excited for was Apple’s spam-fighting feature to silence those
   infuriating robocalls driving us all mad. And if you’re looking to free
   yourself from the hell of incessant, unwanted calls from unknown
   numbers, this is absolutely the feature for you. That said, you should
   also be aware of some problems you might bump into with the tool
   enabled.

   To turn the feature on, navigate to Settings and then Phone, where
   you’ll find the Silence Uknown Callers option. With this feature turned
   on, calls from unknown numbers will be forwarded straight to voicemail
   and listed in Recents. (Missed calls will still leave push
   notifications, and another notification will appear if a voicemail was
   left.) In order to help navigate which calls should be sent to
   voicemail and which ones you may not have saved but might want to
   receive, Apple says the feature silences all unknown calls except for
   those a user has previously called, numbers saved in Contacts, and
   those that Siri suggests from Mail and Messages.

   This is, to be sure, a fantastic feature if you’re constantly up
   against a tidal wave of calls from unknown numbers. It also might make
   it easier to claim that you missed a call if, say, you need an excuse
   for failing to return one. (Oops!) But because the filter silences all
   unknown callers, having the feature enabled means you could also miss
   an important call from work or your doctor’s office, assuming those
   numbers aren’t saved in your phone. I recently missed a call from my
   significant other, for example, who called from an unsaved office
   phone.

   There also appear to be some bugs Apple has yet to work out (though,
   arguably, that’s to be expected with a v1 rollout of a new OS). The
   filter shouldn’t silence incoming text messages, but members of the
   Gizmodo staff seemed to run into some glitches. I, as well as Senior
   Reviews Editor Alex Cranz, had issues with push notifications for text
   messages from unknown numbers.

   Both of us placed delivery orders and were mortified to learn that we
   were not being notified of texts or calls coming through from our
   couriers, leaving those delivery workers in the lurch when they needed
   to reach us. Alex noted her delivery person tried contacting her from
   their personal phone number, and the calls were immediately routed to
   voicemail.

   The company through which my delivery was placed, Shipt, says it masks
   numbers to protect the security of both its shoppers and customers.
   This suggests both private numbers and those regularly used by services
   like Shipt or FreshDirect are subject to the rerouting.

   Advertisement

   The feature also appeared to be buggy for text messages to and from
   other members of our team. When I tried to text Senior Editor Adam
   Clark Estes, he got a notification on his laptop but not his phone.
   When Alex tried to text me from her iPhone, and vice versa, no
   notification populated on the home screen—at first. Several
   back-and-forth texts later, iOS not only began surfacing notifications
   on the home screen but also suggested who the text was from (i.e.
   “Maybe: Alex Cranz”).

   Apple declined to comment.

   All in all, it’s a good and welcome feature given the present scourge
   of bots and spam calls. It’s not the only one though. Most carriers in
   the U.S. now have some kind of spam-blocking feature, which typically
   blocks numbers from known spammers and nothing else. Apple’s solution
   is a little more severe, but potentially useful if you’re harassed by
   the billions of spam calls placed to U.S. numbers every year.

   We’d like to know whether you’ve enabled this feature and love it for
   batting away spam and robo-callers or whether you’ve found it buggy or
   troublesome. Have you hit any unforeseen snags with the filter turned
   on? Let us know down below!

   Clarification: After publication, a spokesperson for Shipt told Gizmodo
   by email that after looking into the issue, it hadn’t received any
   other reports of communication issues since iOS 13 went live. Still, if
   you have this feature enabled, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your
   phone if you’re expecting a call from your delivery courier. Don’t be
   like us!
