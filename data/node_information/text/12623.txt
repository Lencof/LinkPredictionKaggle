Notes

     * The Part Number column shows representative part numbers only,
       which may not be available for sale in the precise form shown. Each
       Part Number constitutes a product family which may contain multiple
       associated product configurations.
       (#) Under the RoHS Compatible Product(s) column, "Available" means
       at least one RoHS-Compatible product is available for sale in the
       corresponding product family. "None" means no RoHS Compatible
       product is available in that product family. For Toshiba's
       definitions of concepts related to the RoHS Directive and RoHS
       Compatibility, please click here.
       The RoHS compatibility information provided herein is to the best
       of Toshiba's knowledge and belief accurate as of the date Toshiba
       entered the information into this database. Information is subject
       to change at any time without notice.
       Please contact your Toshiba sales representative for detailed
       environmental information about each specific part number or
       product, such as RoHS compatibility or material content. Please use
       Toshiba products only in compliance with all applicable laws and
       regulations concerning the inclusion or use of controlled
       substances, including without limitation the RoHS Directive.TOSHIBA

     * The Part Number column shows representative part numbers only,
       which may not be available for sale in the precise form shown. Each
       Part Number constitutes a product family which may contain multiple
       associated product configurations.
       (#) Under the RoHS Compatible Product(s) column, "Available" means
       at least one RoHS-Compatible product is available for sale in the
       corresponding product family. "None" means no RoHS Compatible
       product is available in that product family. For Toshiba's
       definitions of concepts related to the RoHS Directive and RoHS
       Compatibility, please click here.
