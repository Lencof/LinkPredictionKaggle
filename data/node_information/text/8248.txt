House passes cannabis-banking bill, but getting Senate’s OK still looks
tricky

   The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives late Wednesday voted
   to pass a bill protecting banks that work with the marijuana industry,
   but some analysts are warning that the measure isn’t likely to become
   law in 2019 as it faces a tough road in the Republican-controlled
   Senate.

   The chances of enactment this year for the bill — known as the Secure
   And Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act — have risen to 1 in 3, up from
   1 in 5, reckons Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners. Those
   still aren’t great odds, however. “We remain skeptical for now,” Katz
   said in a note before the House vote, though he added that the chances
   could get better “if we see meaningful signals from the Senate in the
   next few weeks.”

   The bill aims to give clarification to banks and credit unions that
   serve cannabis companies with, for instance, business accounts for bill
   paying. Currently, financial institutions face legal problems because
   marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, even as more states
   legalize it. Lobbyists have emphasized that many cannabis businesses
   end up “unbanked” and operating largely in cash, and that makes them
   targets for robberies and other crimes.

   See: Cannabis company’s CEO says being unbanked meant paying $3 million
   tax bill in cash

   And read: Cannabis companies have secret formulas to determine when the
   U.S. may allow pot sales

   Influential Republican Sen. Mike Crapo gave some hope to the SAFE
   Banking Act’s supporters earlier this month, as the Senate Banking
   Committee chairman told Politico that he wanted to hold a committee
   vote before the year’s end on a cannabis banking bill. There are no
   additional details on the potential timing for such a vote, said a
   spokeswoman for the Idaho lawmaker on Monday. Crapo had sounded
   noncommittal on the issue at a July hearing.

   The SAFE Banking Act “has been sweetened for Republicans,” Katz said.
   One provision would prevent the return of Operation Choke Point, an
   Obama-era program that Crapo mentioned at the July hearing and that
   involved investigating banks for doing business with payday lenders and
   firearms dealers. Another new provision aims to protect financial firms
   that serve the hemp industry, which is a force in Kentucky, the home
   state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

   But McConnell continues to look like he could serve as a big roadblock
   to the bill. He described marijuana last year as hemp’s “illicit cousin
   which I choose not to embrace.”

   “There’s a line of thinking that McConnell could go along with a pot
   banking bill to help Republicans in the 2020 elections,” Katz said.
   “The tough re-election prospects of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner [a
   co-sponsor of the bill] of marijuana-friendly Colorado are often cited.
   But the benefit to Republicans, especially in the West and South, of
   supporting a bill that’s at least superficially pro-marijuana, is
   debatable.”

   At the other end of the political spectrum, the bill had faced
   opposition ahead of Wednesday’s House vote from several progressive
   groups, such as the Center for American Progress, the American Civil
   Liberties Union and others. In a letter to top House Democrats, the
   groups criticized the efforts to advance a bill that just addresses
   banking issues, but does not help “communities who have felt the brunt
   of prohibition,” yet have been “shut out” of the growing industry.
   Their concerns didn’t end up stopping the House from passing the
   measure.

   Even with the SAFE Banking Act set to get the House’s OK, Height
   Capital Markets analysts said in a note before that chamber’s vote that
   they “maintain our less than 25% odds that cannabis legislation is
   enacted during the 116th Congress.” Other analysts are more upbeat on
   the bill’s prospects. This week’s vote “will pressure the Senate to
   pass similar legislation, and the SAFE Act should become law before the
   2020 election,” said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington
   Research Group, in a note.

   Wednesday’s vote happened under a suspension of House rules that
   limited debate and meant that two-thirds of the lawmakers present and
   voting needed to back the measure. The vote tally was announced as 321
   in favor vs. 103 against.

   Many players in the cannabis industry say banking-related legislation
   will become law at some point in the next few years, even if 2019
   doesn’t bring the action that they hope to see.

   “I’m fairly confident that either the SAFE Act or STATES Act will be
   passed,” said Rob DiPisa, co-chair of law firm Cole Schotz’s Cannabis
   Law Group. “I think the industry has come too far. The cat’s out of the
   bag, and it’s not going to disappear, so banking needs to happen.”

   The STATES Act — whose full name is the Strengthening the Tenth
   Amendment Through Entrusting States Act — would create protections for
   U.S. states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational
   use. Another measure, the Marijuana Justice Act, would go further,
   ending the federal prohibition of the drug and expunging the records of
   people who have served time for marijuana use and possession.

   Pot stocks, as tracked by the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +0.68%
    , have lost 44% over the past 12 months, while the broad S&P 500 index
   SPX, +0.62%  has gained 2%.

Facebook confirms AR glasses, reveals new mapping project

   Bloomberg News/Landov

   Facebook Inc. says it is developing AR glasses and 3-D maps of the
   world.

   By

JonSwartz

   Senior reporter

   Facebook Inc. confirmed on Wednesday it is developing augmented reality
   glasses that should be ready in a few years, and announced a project
   called “Live Maps” that will create 3-D maps of the world.

   Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, vice president of AR/VR at Facebook FB, +0.84%
   , described the maps project as “a shared virtual map of the world” at
   the Oculus Connect developer conference, a get-together that normally
   generates modest headlines but got a whole lot more attention after
   Facebook late Monday said it had acquired a startup that would let
   people control computers with their brains.

   The proposed acquisition of CTRL-Labs, a 4-year-old company developing
   software and a bracelet that measures neuron activity in a subject’s
   arm, has raised interest in the annual AR/VR conference as well as
   alarms among lawmakers and privacy advocates concerned about how the
   social-networking giant sucks up the data of billions of people.

   How Facebook folds CTRL-Labs, which is designing a hands-free pair of
   AR glasses of its own, into its Facebook Reality Labs division is sure
   to be closely scrutinized. Facebook already is the subject of a Federal
   Trade Commission investigation after it reached a $5 billion settlement
   with the FTC earlier this year over data-privacy practices.

   Last week, members of Congress met privately with Facebook Chief
   Executive Mark Zuckerberg to voice their concerns over Facebook’s
   economic power and its privacy issues. The company acknowledged in a
   blog post on Friday that it had suspended “tens of thousands” of apps
   for potentially improper data-collection methods.

   privacy issues

   A video of Live Maps depicted “multi-layer representations of the
   world” such as projected holographic avatars to hang out with through
   traditional maps, crowdsourced data, and footage captured via AR
   glasses and smartphones. It’s the type of Big Brother-like technology
   that got Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +2.27% GOOG, +2.28%  Google’s Street
   View system into legal hot water.

   Bosworth gave no timetable on the availability of Live Maps, which he
   said would “bridge the physical and digital divides.”

   At the same time, rumors have swirled around Facebook’s AR glasses in
   recent days. One recent rumor: It is teaming with Ray-Ban to deliver a
   pair of specs that can live stream the world around you.

   Reporter

   Nike Inc. says children don’t get a lot of attention when they announce
   earnings, but they should.

   Nike’s NKE, +4.16%  Chief Executive Mark Parker said the children
   business is a “critical” one for the company, and the most recent
   back-to-school season was a blockbuster.

   “Overall, children’ footwear and apparel just experienced its biggest
   back-to-school season ever, driving double-digit growth for the
   quarter,” Parker said on the company’s earnings call, according to a
   FactSet transcript.

   Parker said the growth cut across both boys and girls, included the
   basketball category, and was in the triple-digits in the Air Max 270
   business.

   “We see more parents buying on our apps, so we continue to invest in
   more dynamic imagery on our digital platforms, and we’re testing new
   business models through membership to make it easier for parents to buy
   at the pace that their children need new product,” Parker said.

   Nike stock surged in early trading after the athletic giant reported
   earnings and sales that beat expectations.

   Nike stock was up 4.2% in Wednesday trading, closing at a record
   $90.81.

   In addition to children, women are a big opportunity for the company.

   “The quarter showed that Nike is finding ways to make its brand more
   relevant to a broader set of consumers,” wrote UBS analysts led by Jay
   Sole. “Women’s represents Nike’s largest opportunity.”

   UBS quoted Euromonitor data showing that Nike only commands 0.6% of
   women’s apparel share, with the women’s business steady at 22% to 23%
   of overall sales for five years.

   “We believe women’s outgrew men’s in Q1 and accelerated
   quarter-over-quarter,” UBS wrote in a note to clients. “If Q1
   represents the start of a new, long chapter for Nike where it gains
   women’s apparel share, it would mean big earnings per share and stock
   price upside.”

   UBS rates Nike stock as neutral and raised its price target by 9% to
   $95 from $87.

   “Nike continues to see success in launching and scaling new product
   (Joyride, newer Air Max 720/200 franchises, Adapt) and targeting
   under-penetrated areas including women’s, with the pipeline remaining
   full into the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” wrote Baird analysts in a note.

   Baird rates Nike stock as neutral with a $92 price target, which it
   raised from $87.

   Parker and other Nike executives also see the potential in the women’s
   business. Parker said the company saw double-digit growth in women’s
   “off the back of an incredible summer of celebrating female athletes.”

   IPO

   Chief Financial Officer Andrew Campion said the women’s apparel
   business in North America is growing at “a very strong rate.”

   Susquehanna Financial Group, looking at the broad picture, said there
   is momentum across geographies and channels as well as product
   categories.

   “The company continues to take share by: 1) delivering more compelling
   innovation at a faster pace than competitors; and 2) continuing to
   enhance customer engagement via digital platforms,” analysts wrote.

   Susquehanna rates Nike stock as positive with a $106 price target,
   raised from $100.

   Nike shares have gained 22.5% for the year to date while the Dow Jones
   Industrial Average DJIA, +0.61% is up 15.6% for the period.

House passes cannabis-banking bill, but getting Senate’s OK still looks

   The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives late Wednesday voted
   to pass a bill protecting banks that work with the marijuana industry,
   but some analysts are warning that the measure isn’t likely to become
   law in 2019 as it faces a tough road in the Republican-controlled
   Senate.

   The chances of enactment this year for the bill — known as the Secure
   And Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act — have risen to 1 in 3, up from
   1 in 5, reckons Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners. Those
   still aren’t great odds, however. “We remain skeptical for now,” Katz
   said in a note before the House vote, though he added that the chances
   could get better “if we see meaningful signals from the Senate in the
   next few weeks.”

   The bill aims to give clarification to banks and credit unions that
   serve cannabis companies with, for instance, business accounts for bill
   paying. Currently, financial institutions face legal problems because
   marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, even as more states
   legalize it. Lobbyists have emphasized that many cannabis businesses
   end up “unbanked” and operating largely in cash, and that makes them
   targets for robberies and other crimes.

   See: Cannabis company’s CEO says being unbanked meant paying $3 million
   tax bill in cash

   And read: Cannabis companies have secret formulas to determine when the
   U.S. may allow pot sales

   Influential Republican Sen. Mike Crapo gave some hope to the SAFE
   Banking Act’s supporters earlier this month, as the Senate Banking
   Committee chairman told Politico that he wanted to hold a committee
   vote before the year’s end on a cannabis banking bill. There are no
   additional details on the potential timing for such a vote, said a
   spokeswoman for the Idaho lawmaker on Monday. Crapo had sounded
   noncommittal on the issue at a July hearing.

   The SAFE Banking Act “has been sweetened for Republicans,” Katz said.
   One provision would prevent the return of Operation Choke Point, an
   Obama-era program that Crapo mentioned at the July hearing and that
   involved investigating banks for doing business with payday lenders and
   firearms dealers. Another new provision aims to protect financial firms
   that serve the hemp industry, which is a force in Kentucky, the home
   state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

   But McConnell continues to look like he could serve as a big roadblock
   to the bill. He described marijuana last year as hemp’s “illicit cousin
   which I choose not to embrace.”

   “There’s a line of thinking that McConnell could go along with a pot
   banking bill to help Republicans in the 2020 elections,” Katz said.
   “The tough re-election prospects of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner [a
   co-sponsor of the bill] of marijuana-friendly Colorado are often cited.
   But the benefit to Republicans, especially in the West and South, of
   supporting a bill that’s at least superficially pro-marijuana, is
   debatable.”

   At the other end of the political spectrum, the bill had faced
   opposition ahead of Wednesday’s House vote from several progressive
   groups, such as the Center for American Progress, the American Civil
   Liberties Union and others. In a letter to top House Democrats, the
   groups criticized the efforts to advance a bill that just addresses
   banking issues, but does not help “communities who have felt the brunt
   of prohibition,” yet have been “shut out” of the growing industry.
   Their concerns didn’t end up stopping the House from passing the
   measure.

   Even with the SAFE Banking Act set to get the House’s OK, Height
   Capital Markets analysts said in a note before that chamber’s vote that
   they “maintain our less than 25% odds that cannabis legislation is
   enacted during the 116th Congress.” Other analysts are more upbeat on
   the bill’s prospects. This week’s vote “will pressure the Senate to
   pass similar legislation, and the SAFE Act should become law before the
   2020 election,” said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington
   Research Group, in a note.

   Wednesday’s vote happened under a suspension of House rules that
   limited debate and meant that two-thirds of the lawmakers present and
   voting needed to back the measure. The vote tally was announced as 321
   in favor vs. 103 against.

   Many players in the cannabis industry say banking-related legislation
   will become law at some point in the next few years, even if 2019
   doesn’t bring the action that they hope to see.

   “I’m fairly confident that either the SAFE Act or STATES Act will be
   passed,” said Rob DiPisa, co-chair of law firm Cole Schotz’s Cannabis
   Law Group. “I think the industry has come too far. The cat’s out of the
   bag, and it’s not going to disappear, so banking needs to happen.”

   The STATES Act — whose full name is the Strengthening the Tenth
   Amendment Through Entrusting States Act — would create protections for
   U.S. states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational
   use. Another measure, the Marijuana Justice Act, would go further,
   ending the federal prohibition of the drug and expunging the records of
   people who have served time for marijuana use and possession.

   Pot stocks, as tracked by the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +0.68%
    , have lost 44% over the past 12 months, while the broad S&P 500 index
   SPX, +0.62%  has gained 2%.

   The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives late Wednesday voted
   to pass a bill protecting banks that work with the marijuana industry,
   but some analysts are warning that the measure isn’t likely to become
   law in 2019 as it faces a tough road in the Republican-controlled
   Senate.

   The chances of enactment this year for the bill — known as the Secure
   And Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act — have risen to 1 in 3, up from
   1 in 5, reckons Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners. Those
   still aren’t great odds, however. “We remain skeptical for now,” Katz
   said in a note before the House vote, though he added that the chances
   could get better “if we see meaningful signals from the Senate in the
   next few weeks.”

   The bill aims to give clarification to banks and credit unions that
   serve cannabis companies with, for instance, business accounts for bill
   paying. Currently, financial institutions face legal problems because
   marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, even as more states
   legalize it. Lobbyists have emphasized that many cannabis businesses
   end up “unbanked” and operating largely in cash, and that makes them
   targets for robberies and other crimes.

   Influential Republican Sen. Mike Crapo gave some hope to the SAFE
   Banking Act’s supporters earlier this month, as the Senate Banking
   Committee chairman told Politico that he wanted to hold a committee
   vote before the year’s end on a cannabis banking bill. There are no
   additional details on the potential timing for such a vote, said a
   spokeswoman for the Idaho lawmaker on Monday. Crapo had sounded
   noncommittal on the issue at a July hearing.

   The SAFE Banking Act “has been sweetened for Republicans,” Katz said.
   One provision would prevent the return of Operation Choke Point, an
   Obama-era program that Crapo mentioned at the July hearing and that
   involved investigating banks for doing business with payday lenders and
   firearms dealers. Another new provision aims to protect financial firms
   that serve the hemp industry, which is a force in Kentucky, the home
   state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

   But McConnell continues to look like he could serve as a big roadblock
   to the bill. He described marijuana last year as hemp’s “illicit cousin
   which I choose not to embrace.”

   “There’s a line of thinking that McConnell could go along with a pot
   banking bill to help Republicans in the 2020 elections,” Katz said.
   “The tough re-election prospects of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner [a
   co-sponsor of the bill] of marijuana-friendly Colorado are often cited.
   But the benefit to Republicans, especially in the West and South, of
   supporting a bill that’s at least superficially pro-marijuana, is
   debatable.”

   At the other end of the political spectrum, the bill had faced
   opposition ahead of Wednesday’s House vote from several progressive
   groups, such as the Center for American Progress, the American Civil
   Liberties Union and others. In a letter to top House Democrats, the
   groups criticized the efforts to advance a bill that just addresses
   banking issues, but does not help “communities who have felt the brunt
   of prohibition,” yet have been “shut out” of the growing industry.
   Their concerns didn’t end up stopping the House from passing the
   measure.

   Even with the SAFE Banking Act set to get the House’s OK, Height
   Capital Markets analysts said in a note before that chamber’s vote that
   they “maintain our less than 25% odds that cannabis legislation is
   enacted during the 116th Congress.” Other analysts are more upbeat on
   the bill’s prospects. This week’s vote “will pressure the Senate to
   pass similar legislation, and the SAFE Act should become law before the
   2020 election,” said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington
   Research Group, in a note.

   Wednesday’s vote happened under a suspension of House rules that
   limited debate and meant that two-thirds of the lawmakers present and
   voting needed to back the measure. The vote tally was announced as 321
   in favor vs. 103 against.

   Many players in the cannabis industry say banking-related legislation
   will become law at some point in the next few years, even if 2019
   doesn’t bring the action that they hope to see.

   “I’m fairly confident that either the SAFE Act or STATES Act will be
   passed,” said Rob DiPisa, co-chair of law firm Cole Schotz’s Cannabis
   Law Group. “I think the industry has come too far. The cat’s out of the
   bag, and it’s not going to disappear, so banking needs to happen.”

   The STATES Act — whose full name is the Strengthening the Tenth
   Amendment Through Entrusting States Act — would create protections for
   U.S. states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational
   use. Another measure, the Marijuana Justice Act, would go further,
   ending the federal prohibition of the drug and expunging the records of
   people who have served time for marijuana use and possession.

   SPX+0.62%  has gained 2%.
