What Happened the Day a Giant, Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Hit the Earth

Using rock cores from Chicxulub crater, geologists piece together a new
timeline of the destruction that followed impact

   September 9, 2019

   One of the greatest scars on our planet is hidden beneath the Yucatán
   Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico. The buried crater, over 90 miles in
   diameter, was created when a massive asteroid struck the planet 66
   million years ago and brought a calamitous end to the reign of
   dinosaurs. Now, thanks to a new analysis of core samples taken from the
   crater’s inner ring of mountains, called a peak ring, geologists can
   create a detailed timeline of what happened on the day after impact.

   The immense Chicxulub crater is a remnant of one of the most
   consequential days in the history of life on Earth. The asteroid strike
   triggered the Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, mass extinction. The
   catastrophe not only decimated the dinosaurs, leaving only birds to
   carry their legacy, but also annihilated various forms of life from
   flying reptiles called pterosaurs to coil-shelled nautilus relatives
   called ammonites. Lizards, snakes, mammals and more suffered their own
   setbacks. The best clues to what happened now lie buried in rock layers
   stacked 12 miles deep.

   Using a core sample collected in 2016, University of Texas at Austin
   geologist Sean Gulick and a team of dozens of other researchers have
   further pieced together the story of the Cretaceous-Paleogene
   extinction. “We interpret this section to represent the first day post
   impact, which by the definition of the geologic time scale, makes it
   the first day of the Cenozoic since the Cretaceous ended the moment the
   asteroid struck,” Gulick says. The team’s study, “The first day of the
   Cenozoic,” was published today in the Proceedings of the National
   Academy of Sciences.

   The drill site was selected to investigate the series of events that
   followed the impact. When an asteroid the size of the Chicxulub
   impactor, estimated to be more than six miles wide, strikes a planet,
   material is ripped up from below the surface and tossed into the air,
   collapsing in circular mountain range within the crater. Such
   devastating upheaval triggers a cascading sequence of natural
   disasters, sending tsunamis rolling across the oceans and ejecting an
   immense amount of debris into the atmosphere.

   The core sample is a geologic document stretching hundreds of feet
   long. Under a thin ring of overlying material is over 400 feet of melt
   rock that was laid down during the day following the impact.

   Discovery Program) studies rock cores from the Chicxulub impact crater

   “This isn’t the first drill core from Chicxulub,” says University of
   New Mexico geologist James Witts, “but because of its position on the
   peak ring, which is essentially a range of mountains created in the
   moments after the impact event, it provides a really unique picture of
   the sort of dynamic geological processes that operated over short
   timescales.” An event of this scale has never occurred in human
   history, he adds, so the rock record is essential to parsing out the
   details.

   Within minutes of the asteroid strike, Gulick and colleagues found, the
   underlying rock at the site collapsed and formed a crater with a peak
   ring. The ring was soon covered by over 70 feet of additional rock that
   had melted in the heat of the blast.

   The sea battered against the new hole in the planet, and in the minutes
   and hours that followed, surges of water rushing back into the crater
   carried laid down more than 260 additional feet of melted stone atop
   the already accumulated rock. Then a tsunami hit. The wave, reflected
   back toward the crater after the initial impact, added another distinct
   layer of rock—sediments of gravel, sand and charcoal—all within the
   first 24 hours of the strike.

   The planetary collision triggered wildfires inland, burning forests
   that were later doused by devastating waves. Debris from the charred
   woods washed out to sea, and some accumulated in the crater.

   “What we have from drilling at ground zero is a fairly complete picture
   of how the crater formed and what the processes were within the crater
   on the first day of the Cenozoic,” Gulick says.

   The impact affected life far from the site. The heat pulse would have
   raised temperatures over 900 miles away, Gulick says, and “at farther
   distances the ejecta could also have caused fires by frictional heating
   as it rained down in the atmosphere.”

   into the peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater took place. (Image

   Austin)

   The rocks that the asteroid struck were rich in sulfur, which was
   ejected and vaporized, mixing with water vapor and creating what Gulick
   calls a sulfate aerosol haze. Geologists had detected and studied this
   effect before, but the new research reinforces the role this
   atmospheric disruption played in the extinction that followed.

   “Our results support this scenario where first you burned parts of the
   continents, and then you had global dimming of the sun and plummeting
   temperatures for years to follow,” Gulick says. These events account
   for the loss of 75 percent of known species at the end of the
   Cretaceous. Had the impact occurred elsewhere, or in a place of deeper
   ocean water, the extinction may have happened differently, or not at
   all.

   Cores from Chicxulub crater reveal the planet-wide devastation that the
   large impactor caused, but the timing of these events will likely spur
   debate and discussion, Witts says. “The complication with relating
   individual deposits in the core to specific types of events is that
   clearly the crater wasn’t a static environment after formation,” Witts
   says, meaning that earthquakes, waves and other events have altered the
   rock record over the course of 66 million years. Still cores like the
   one taken from the peak ring show that we can get a close-up look at
   short-term events in the rock record, down to minutes, hours and days.

   Scientists knew the first day of the Cenozoic started with a bang, and
   now they have a better sense of the fallout.

The Psychology Behind Superhero Origin Stories

How does following the adventures of Spider-Man and Batman inspire us to cope
with adversity?

   Batman mask Superhero origin stories help us cope with adversity.
   (www.halloweencostumes.com)
   By Robin Rosenberg
   Smithsonian Magazine | Subscribe
   February 2013

   “Why is every superhero movie an origin story?” complained
   Entertainment Weekly film critic Adam Markovitz after seeing a trailer
   for this summer’s Man of Steel—yet another version of the 75-year-old
   Superman saga. Perhaps we love origin stories, Markovitz suggested,
   because they “show the exact moment when a normal guy goes from being
   Just Like Us to being somehow better, faster, stronger.”

     * Why the Best Success Stories Often Begin With Failure
     * Superheroes’ Most Amazing Power: Getting Kids to Choose Healthy
       Snacks Over French Fries

   I’m inclined to disagree. As a clinical psychologist who has written
   books about the psychology of superheroes, I think origin stories show
   us not how to become super but how to be heroes, choosing altruism over
   the pursuit of wealth and power. I’ve learned this through hundreds of
   conversations at comic book conventions, where fans have been
   remarkably candid about their lives and the inspiration they draw from
   superhero stories.

   In one form or another the superhero origin story has been around for
   millennia: A hero battles “supernatural” forces and returns home “from
   this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow
   man,” as the mythologist Joseph Campbell wrote.

   In my surveys of the genre, I’ve found that superheroes undergo three
   types of life-altering experiences that we can relate to.

   The first is trauma, which lies at the heart of Batman’s origin story,
   in which Bruce Wayne dedicates himself to fighting crime after seeing
   his parents murdered. In real life, many people experience
   “stress-induced growth” after a trauma and resolve to help others, even
   becoming social activists.

   The second life-altering force is destiny. Consider Buffy the Vampire
   Slayer, about a normal teenager who discovers she’s the “Chosen
   One”—endowed with supernatural powers to fight demons. Buffy is
   reluctant to accept her destiny, yet she throws herself into her new
   job. Many of us identify with Buffy’s challenge (minus the vampires) of
   assuming a great responsibility that compels her to grow up sooner than
   she wants to.

   Lastly, there’s sheer chance, which transformed a young Spider-Man, who
   was using his power for selfish purposes until his beloved uncle was
   murdered by a street thug. Spider-Man’s heroism is an example of how
   random adverse events cause many of us to take stock of our lives and
   choose a different path.

   At their best, superhero origin stories inspire us and provide models
   of coping with adversity, finding meaning in loss and trauma,
   discovering our strengths and using them for good purpose. (Wearing a
   cape or tights is optional.)

   Comic book writers could have chosen not to endow their characters with
   origin stories. (In fact, Batman’s back story wasn’t published until
   the comic’s seventh installment.) But those writers were keen observers
   of human nature. And they were able to translate those observations
   into captivating stories reflecting aspects of psychology that were
   confirmed by researchers decades later. In doing so, they tap into our
   capacity for empathy, one of the greatest powers of all.

Photo of the day

   The Pantanal of Brazil is full of strange creatures, none more so than
   the giant anteater. With very poor eyesight, these creatures rely on
   their sense of smell to locate not just ants and termites below the
   surface of the Earth, but also danger and predators. While taking a
   break from eating at a feverish pace, this anteater raised his head and
   seemingly without trying matched the tall grass around him as he swung
   from side to side, smelling for danger. An Anteater Comes Up for Air
