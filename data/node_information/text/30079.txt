Users are downloading Windows 10 whether they want to or not

   It turns out that, even if you hadn’t asked for it, the odds are your
   non-Apple computer has already downloaded Windows 10 — to save time.

   The automatic Windows 10 download can happen without you knowing, lying
   dormant on your machine until you seek to make the switch.

   The download is between 3.5Gb to 6Gb in size, creating a ‘$Windows.~BT’
   folder on your system, as revealed by The Inquirer.

   That kind of file size can cause problems if you’re running close to
   your capacity, or your computer only has, say, 32Gb to play with in the
   first place.

   But Microsoft claims this is for brevity, getting things in order for
   people to upgrade in a timely fashion.

   “For individuals who have chosen to receive automatic updates through
   Windows Update, we help upgradable devices get ready for Windows 10 by
   downloading the files they’ll need if they decide to upgrade,” said the
   company in a statement.

   “When the upgrade is ready, the customer will be prompted to install
   Windows 10 on the device.”

   It’s a little odd, in that automatic updates are usually reserved for
   patches and bug fixes. In this instance an entire OS is landing on your
   machine, lying in wait.

   Microsoft is understandably keen to see as many people upgrade to its
   new toy as possible, with 75m upgrading within a month.

   It has received largely favourable reviews, too, but it’s still awful
   presumptuous of Microsoft to think everyone will happily take the
   plunge.

   After the change between Windows 7 and Windows 8 became less and less
   appealing to users, blanket support for an immediate, unsolicited
   change vanished.

   It’s weird, although not as weird as the old way Microsoft encouraged
   you to upgrade:

Me, EU and the IMF social media storm

   In his look back on the past week, Siliconrepublic editor John Kennedy
   concedes that from a social-media perspective, everything pales this
   week in comparison to the Irish financial bailout. Even the Beatles
   arriving on iTunes failed to move him.

   You know there’s a joke doing the rounds on Twitter this morning. It
   goes: "Breaking News: Steve Jobs is to buy Ireland to solve the debt
   problem. It will be rebranded iLand."

   Well, I suppose it’s better than the Iceland joke that did the rounds
   when the banking crisis began to unravel.

   Social media is really becoming the bellwether for people’s feelings,
   jocular or angry or otherwise, on the matter and during the times
   that’s in it let’s look at how people are tracking and handling it.

   It’s a pity not enough Irish politicians have embraced social media
   because if they really wanted to understand people’s mindsets around
   this time, Twitter and Facebook sum it up pretty well.

   On Twitter, hashtags such as #bailout and #imf give a fairly good
   picture but it’s usually during Prime Time (#rtept) that tempers really
   hot up. Seriously, it’s worth watching and contributing if you have
   something to say.

   On Facebook, the sudden omission of Vincent Browne’s questions on RTE
   last night apparently for technical reasons has led to the launch of a
   campaign against alleged censorship while another Facebook campaign
   calling for a general election has 10,000 fans and intends to reach
   50,000.

   While the drama of the EU/IMF bailout will no doubt unfold in
   newspapers and on our airwaves, it would be wise to start paying
   attention to what people are saying and thinking on forums like Twitter
   and Facebook; it is visceral and raw and the people commenting aren’t
   just technology people, they increasingly consist of well-known
   broadcasters, legal professionals and frankly, a broadening walk of
   life.

   So, where were you?

   Personally, I envy people who can spend long lengths of time on either
   Twitter or Facebook, I’m usually drawn between using it as a work tool
   for research and sharing stories.

   But keeping an eye on these forums in the midst of unprecedented
   historical events is also an opportunity to put a personal stamp on
   them, too.

   Facebook has in excess of 500 million users and Twitter has 160 million
   and counting. Who knows what social media platforms (will we even call
   them such) will dominate in the years to come as internet comes to TV
   and mobile devices take on the attributes of supercomputers. Some 1.3
   million Irish people are on Facebook and it emerged this morning that
   one-fifth of Irish people carry a smartphone. The opportunities to
   speak are accelerating in pace.

Watermark for our times

   But, as many of us who have felt the powerful impact of being able to
   check through the records of things like the 1901 census and seeing
   where and how relatives lived, signed their names and earned their
   livings, who’s to say that the views and opinions of people at a
   particular point in history can’t be found decades from now.

   People used to ask questions like, "Do you know what your grandparents
   were doing in 1916?" People used to say they would always remember
   where they were when JFK was shot or during the horrible events of 911.

   For better or worse, tools like Facebook or Twitter could give a nice
   insight into what people were saying and thinking during pivotal events
   like the EU/IMF intervention in the Irish economy. This could leave a
   valuable resource for future generations, it could be a call to action,
   but whatever it is, it’s as mesmerising as it is magical.

   I waited years for The Beatles to finally make it to iTunes, but
   frankly, I knew where my eyes were glued during a tumultuous week in
   Dublin in late November 2010.
