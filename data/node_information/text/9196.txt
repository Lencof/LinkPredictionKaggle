What is computational linguistics?

   Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a
   computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in
   providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic
   phenomena. These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or
   "data-driven" ("statistical" or "empirical"). Work in computational
   linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in
   that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a
   particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other
   cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants
   to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system.
   Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many
   working systems today, including speech recognition systems,
   text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web
   search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name
   just a few.

   Popular computational linguistics textbooks include:
     * Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schütze (1999) Foundations of
       Statistical Natural Language Processing, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
       USA. MIT Press.
       Also see the book's supplemental materials website at Stanford.

       Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech
       Recognition, Second Edition. Prentice Hall.
