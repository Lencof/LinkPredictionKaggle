Cookie Policy

   Effective 5/22/2018

   Synology websites and certain online services may use cookies, which
   are files that are placed on your device to enable data collection. If
   you opt-in to our use of cookies, we will use the information collected
   by cookies to better understand how you navigate our website and to
   assess your engagement, to remember customized settings and
   preferences, such as your language choice, and for purposes of
   personalizing marketing measures and re-marketing. All cookies will
   expire in 540 days from the day you visit Synology websites. After you
   have opted-in to our use of cookies, you can disable cookies by
   modifying settings in your browser. If you choose to do so, some
   functionalities that are dependent on cookies may not function
   properly. The following categories are defined by ICC UK Cookie guide.

Category 1 – Strictly necessary cookies

   These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the
   website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the
   website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like
   payment services or account authorization, cannot be provided.

Category 2 – Performance cookies

   These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for
   instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error
   messages from web pages. These cookies do not collect information that
   identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is
   aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
   website works.

Category 3 – Functionality cookies

   These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as
   your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide
   enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to
   remember changes you have to parts of web pages that you can customize.
   They may also be used to keep track of which notices you have already
   viewed to avoid repetition. The information these cookies collect will
   not personally identify you and cannot track your browsing activity on
   other websites.

Category 4 – Targeting cookies or advertising cookies

   These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your
   interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
   advertisement as well as help to measure the effectiveness of the
   advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks
   with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have
   visited a website and this information is shared with other
   organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising
   cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other
   organization. For example, in our remarketing or retargeting campaigns,
   we will serve targeted ads to you after you have visited or taken
   action on our website. In terms of technical execution, remarketing is
   the process of using a JavaScript tag to place a cookie in your
   browser. The cookie then informs a remarketing platform to serve
   specific display ads through an ad exchange, based on the pages or
   products you have engaged with or searched for on our website or app.

How do I refuse my consent to the use of cookies?

   If you do not want cookies to be stored on your device, you can adjust
   the setting of your browser to reject the setting of all or some
   cookies, and to alert you when a new cookie is added. For further
   information about how to do so, please refer to your browser help
   documentation. Please note that if you use your browser settings to
   block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies) you may not be
   able to access or use all or parts or functionalities of our sites.
   If you want to remove previously-stored cookies, you can manually
   delete the cookies at any time. However, this will not prevent the
   sites from placing further cookies on your device unless you adjust
   your browser setting as described above.
   For more information on the development of user-profiles and the use of
   targeting and advertising cookies, please see www.youronlinechoices.eu
   if you are located in Europe, or www.aboutads.info/choices if in the
   United States.
