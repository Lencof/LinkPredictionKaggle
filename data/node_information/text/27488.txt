The ESRF is the world's most intense X-ray source and a centre of excellence
for fundamental and innovation-driven research in condensed and living matter
science. Located in Grenoble, France, the ESRF owes its success to the
international cooperation of 22 partner nations, of which 13 are Members and
9 are Associates.

   What is the ESRF? What does it do? How does it work? Discover the
   European synchrotron with this video.

   All the videos of the ESRF are available on our  YouTube channel Light
   for science.

   The ESRF - The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility - is the most
   intense source of synchrotron-generated light, producing X-rays 100
   billion times brighter than the X-rays used in hospitals. These X-rays,
   endowed with exceptional properties, are produced at the ESRF by the
   high energy electrons that race around the storage ring, a circular
   tunnel measuring 844 metres in circumference.
   Each year, the demand to use these X-ray beams increases and near to
   9000 scientists from around the world come to Grenoble, to “beamlines”,
   each equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation, operating 24 hours
   a day, seven days a week.

   Thanks to the brilliance and quality of its X-rays, the ESRF functions
   like a "super-microscope" which "films" the position and motion of
   atoms in condensed and living matter, and reveals the structure of
   matter in all its beauty and complexity. It provides unrivalled
   opportunities for scientists in the exploration of materials and living
   matter in many fields: chemistry, material physics, archaeology and
   cultural heritage, structural biology and medical applications,
   environmental sciences, information science and nanotechnologies.

   Thirty years ago the ESRF made history as the world’s first
   third-generation synchrotron light source, providing unrivalled
   opportunities for scientists in the exploration of materials and living
   matter. Following 30 years of success, breaking records for its
   scientific output as well as for the brilliance and stability of its
   X-ray beams, the ESRF continues to lead the way with the Extremely
   Brilliant Source (EBS) project. With EBS, the ESRF is building an
   ambitious new standard for synchrotron storage rings – the world’s
   first high-energy, fourth-generation storage ring – with unique X-ray
   performances increased by a factor 100. By pushing the frontiers of
   accelerator technology, EBS reinforces what has always been, and will
   always be, the ESRF’s mission:  to pioneer synchrotron science for the
   benefit of the international community.

   The ESRF was conceived as a true European collaboration for the
   advancement of X-ray science. In 1988, eleven European countries joined
   forces to build the world’s most performing and bright
   « third-generation » light source. This visionary project has made an
   outstanding contribution to the excellence of European science. Almost
   thirty years later, the ESRF is a world reference, developing
   innovative technologies which also benefit other national synchrotrons.
   Today, the ESRF continues to lead the way in pushing back the
   boundaries of scientific exploration of matter, by constructing the
   first in a new generation of synchrotrons.

                   1990_Aerial view.jpg         firstbeamweb.jpg
            The ESRF construction site in 1990.

                           The first beam, in 1992.

   1975: Professor William Garton of Imperial College London (UK) writes a
   letter to Sir Brian Flowers, then president of the European Science
   Foundation, pleading for a European collaboration in synchrotron
   research.

   1976-1979: A working group of experts present a proposal for the
   construction of a synchrotron facility. They publish the Black book and
   the Blue book, where they set the specifications for the machine.

   1977: The term “European Synchrotron Radiation Facility” is used for
   the first time.

   1987: After the publication of several technical books, the Red Book,
   also known as the “Bible” of the ESRF, comes to life. This is the
   reference document for construction.

   1988: The Convention and Statutes of the ESRF are signed in Paris by
   research ministers of 11 European countries.

   1989: The ESRF company is established. The first Users’ Meeting takes
   place the same year.

   1992: First electron beam in the storage ring. First users at the ESRF.

   1994: User Operation starts. The ESRF is officially inaugurated with 15
   beamlines. The storage ring current is raised to 150 mA; X-ray
   brilliance reaches 10^19 photons/mm^2/mrad^2/0.1%bw.

   1996: Storage ring current is raised to 200 mA; X-ray brilliance
   reaches 10^20 photons/mm^2/mrad^2/0.1%bw.

   1998: The ESRF has 40 beamlines.

   1997: Science magazine includes synchrotrons as one of the
   breakthroughs of 1997.

   2002: The Partnership for Structural Biology is launched with the ILL,
   the EMBL and several local institutions. Today, the PSB comprises about
   300 active scientists and close to 20 technical platforms for
   state-of-the-art integrated structural biology.

   2009-2015: Upgrade Programme Phase I (180M€) is launched. It includes
   the development of 19 new beamlines, many specialised in research using
   nanobeams, a new 8000m^2 ultra-stable experimental hall and the upgrade
   and renewal of facilities and support laboratories.

   2010: The Partnership for Soft Condensed Matter (PSCM) is launched in
   collaboration with ILL. The European Photon and Neutron Science Campus
   (EPN Campus) is created.

   2011: X-ray brilliance of 1 x 10^21 photons/mm^2/mrad^2/0.1%bw is
   reached. This is 500 times brighter than the design specifications.

   2012: The ESRF designs a revolutionary storage ring.

   2012: Publications in peer-reviewed journals since 1994, from users and
   staff, reach a total of 20,000.

   2014: Russia joins the ESRF as a Member State, bringing the total
   number of countries backing the ESRF to twenty-one, of which 13 are
   Members and 8 are Scientific Associates.

   2015: Launch of the Extremely Brilliant Source (ESRF-EBS) Project:
   150M€ over the period 2015-2022, with the construction of a new storage
   ring, inside the existing infrastructure, with performances multiplied
   by 100 in terms of brilliance and coherence of the X-ray beam.

   2017: The ESRF has 44 beamlines.

   2018: The ESRF celebrated its 30th anniversary. After an outstanding
   performance, the ESRF’s X-ray source was shut down for a 20-month
   upgrade to the new Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS).

             only 19 months after the ground-breaking ceremony.

The quest for more brillance and coherence

   “It was a dream; we were living in the future”, said once the late
   Director of the Accelerator and Source Division, Pascal Elleaume. “We
   were working on a completely new project, with no previous reference as
   a guide. It was a thrilling time, he added.

   In 1988, the ESRF made history as the world’s first third-generation
   synchrotron light source. The ESRF served as a model for many
   synchrotrons worlwide, achieving  a brilliance between 100 and 1000
   times greater than that expected at the time of the Red Book.

   Today the teams are mobilised to build the first high-energy
   fourth-generation synchrotron light source, with X-ray performances
   increased by a factor 100.

Nobel Prize Winners

   Several laureates have used the ESRF throughout their careers to carry
   out experiments which have ultimately contributed to their success.
   Synchrotron sources have really made a huge difference in
   macromolecular crystallography research and hence the fact that the
   winners work in the field of biology.

   Synchrotrons provide flexible, powerful methods for learning about the
   structure and behaviour of matter at the molecular and atomic level.

   A synchrotron is a stadium-sized machine that produces many beams of
   bright X-ray light. Each beam is guided through a set of lenses and
   instruments called a beamline, where the X-rays illuminate and interact
   with samples of material being studied. Many countries operate
   synchrotrons—there are 10 in Europe alone—but only four worldwide are
   similar to the ESRF in terms of design and power.
