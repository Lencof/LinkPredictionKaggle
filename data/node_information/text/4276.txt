How to Adopt a Growth Mindset for Your Content Marketing

   Two years ago Coca-Cola scrapped its CMO role in favor of a chief
   growth officer, following the move by other Fortune 100 companies like
   Hershey’s and Kellogg.

   More recently, McDonald’s extinguished the role of CMO and created two
   new senior vice president positions – marketing and marketing tech.

The Weekly Wrap: Is Culture Eating Your Content Strategy for Breakfast?

   Listen to the Weekly Wrap here or subscribe on Apple
   Podcasts or Stitcher. If you enjoy the show, please take a moment
   to rate it or post a review.

And that’s a wrap of the week ending Oct. 4, 2019

   This week I’m thinking about how a tech snafu ate my interview. I also
   explore the need to create a new corporate culture club rather than
   fixing what exists. I offer a fresh take on a news piece that asks
   whether the days of TV advertising are finally over. And I point you to
   an article that explains why the content technology process is failing
   you.

Successful Content Marketers Have These 7 Traits

   Editor’s note: While Joe wrote this piece a couple years ago, we’re
   bringing it back in case you missed it (or in case you want a
   refresher) about what makes a great content marketer.

   One of the most influential authors of my personal and career journey
   is Napoleon Hill.

   Napoleon Hill’s classic Think and Grow Rich was first published in
   1937. Now, in the book’s 82nd year, Mr. Hill’s lessons are still
   extremely relevant and valuable.

3 Life and Marketing Success Resolutions for 2019

   This text and the accompanying 30-minute video comes from my Content
   Marketing World 2018 keynote presentation. On Dec. 31, 2017, I
   “retired” from marketing and took a sabbatical for 2018 (which, as of
   this publishing, I’m still happily on).

   I’ve given over 400 keynote speeches in 18 countries, but this one was
   the most personal. The team at CMI is nice enough to publish this so
   the entire CMI audience can watch and read it. I hope there is
   something here that will help you in your life or your marketing
   (hopefully both).

   Yours in Content,

This Goal-Setting Activity That Made All the Difference

   goal-setting-activity

   This is my last article for a while, so I really wanted this one to
   make an impact and stay with you. Even though the amazing CMI editorial
   team wanted me to write about marketing, I wrote this instead (ha).

   Occasionally, I’ll do an interview where someone will ask: “What’s the
   one thing you did that made the greatest impact to where you are at
   now?”

   It’s my favorite question, both because it’s the easiest to answer and
   something that almost no one does. The answer is about setting goals.
   I’ll get to the specific formula below, but first, let’s take a step
   back.

Are You Ready for Content Marketing in 2018? 60+ Predictions

   content-marketing-predictions-2018

   It’s hard to believe that, after 10 years, this will be the last time I
   share my annual list of content marketing predictions for CMI. Not to
   get all sentimental or anything, but looking into the future of our
   industry and anticipating the content and media trends most likely to
   impact our businesses has always been a favorite part of the job … and
   it will be one of CMI’s content experiences I’ll miss the most as I
   retire from CMI this month.

   But, as change is the only constant, it’s time to put the past aside
   and focus on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. And, if
   anyone can help lead the content marketing industry forward and prepare
   you for what’s to come, it’s the group of experts who contributed to
   our 10^th annual e-book of content marketing predictions.

   can be found on both iTunes and Stitcher. If you enjoy our show, we
   would love it if you would rate it or post a review on iTunes.

In this week’s episode

   In this final regular episode, Robert ponders the nature of doing
   nothing (and doing it well). We discuss which company we feel is most
   likely to buy Fox, and whether Apple will ever really buy Disney. We
   also examine an increasingly disturbing web content trend, and media
   companies’ rush into the agency services business. Our rants and raves
   include net neutrality and audio content; then we sign off with an
   example of the week that takes us back to our own humble roots.

This Week in Content Marketing: Latest Content Marketing Spending Stats Hard
to Believe

   PNR: This Old Marketing with Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose can be found
   on both iTunes and Stitcher. If you enjoy our show, we would love it if
   you would rate it or post a review on iTunes.

In this week’s episode

   This week, Robert ponders the nature of “violent agreement.” We unpack
   the latest content marketing spending research – and debate whether or
   not we can actually believe it. Marketing predictions are back again,
   and we also discuss why Casper is putting Van Winkle’s to sleep. Our
   rants and raves include building an audience, Snapchat, and the art of
   questioning; then we close the show with an example of the week on the
   Maxwell House Haggadah.

17 Questions to Break Free From Competitive Content Issues

   competitive-content In 1998, I became the investment club guide for
   About.com. My responsibilities included the creation of at least one
   original article per week on the topic of investing or investment
   clubs, as well as development of the e-newsletter for the subscribers
   of that channel.

   I absolutely loved it. Every piece of content I created scored more
   traffic. The formula seemed so easy … just create article after article
   answering questions about investment clubs and the audience grew and
   grew.

   About.com had hundreds of guides like me covering almost every topic
   imaginable. By the early 2000s, About.com was one of the largest
   websites (by audience traffic) in the world. At that time, it was all
   about scale … creating content for everybody. Yahoo did it. Microsoft
   did it. Excite.com did it (I owned stock in that little disaster).

   It was about scale until it wasn’t about scale.

This Week in Content Marketing: Is There a Crisis in Content Marketing?

   crisis-content-marketing PNR: This Old Marketing with Joe Pulizzi and
   Robert Rose can be found on both iTunes and Stitcher. If you enjoy our
   show, we would love it if you would rate it or post a review on iTunes.

In this week’s episode

   This week, Robert ponders how we handle filling big shoes. We discuss
   recent reader revenue moves from CNN and the Guardian, and why Facebook
   may have nothing to fear from ad blockers. In other news, we debate
   whether content marketing is in crisis or on the verge of its biggest
   opportunity yet. Our rants and raves cover audience building and how
   the flight to video could hurt publishers; then we close with an
   example of the week on the Electric Boat Company.

How to Adopt a Growth Mindset for Your Content Marketing

   Two years ago Coca-Cola scrapped its CMO role in favor of a chief
   growth officer, following the move by other Fortune 100 companies like
   Hershey’s and Kellogg.

   More recently, McDonald’s extinguished the role of CMO and created two
   new senior vice president positions – marketing and marketing tech.

The Weekly Wrap: Is Culture Eating Your Content Strategy for Breakfast?

   to rate it or post a review.

And that’s a wrap of the week ending Oct. 4, 2019

   This week I’m thinking about how a tech snafu ate my interview. I also
   explore the need to create a new corporate culture club rather than
   fixing what exists. I offer a fresh take on a news piece that asks
   whether the days of TV advertising are finally over. And I point you to
   an article that explains why the content technology process is failing
   you.

Successful Content Marketers Have These 7 Traits

   Editor’s note: While Joe wrote this piece a couple years ago, we’re
   bringing it back in case you missed it (or in case you want a
   refresher) about what makes a great content marketer.

   One of the most influential authors of my personal and career journey
   is Napoleon Hill.

   Napoleon Hill’s classic Think and Grow Rich was first published in
   1937. Now, in the book’s 82nd year, Mr. Hill’s lessons are still
   extremely relevant and valuable.

3 Life and Marketing Success Resolutions for 2019

   This text and the accompanying 30-minute video comes from my Content
   Marketing World 2018 keynote presentation. On Dec. 31, 2017, I
   “retired” from marketing and took a sabbatical for 2018 (which, as of
   this publishing, I’m still happily on).

   I’ve given over 400 keynote speeches in 18 countries, but this one was
   the most personal. The team at CMI is nice enough to publish this so
   the entire CMI audience can watch and read it. I hope there is
   something here that will help you in your life or your marketing
   (hopefully both).

   Yours in Content,

   Joe

   In our grand finale episode, Robert kicks things off by pondering the

   with a final farewell inspired by a few of the greats.

This Goal-Setting Activity That Made All the Difference

   goal-setting-activity

   This is my last article for a while, so I really wanted this one to
   make an impact and stay with you. Even though the amazing CMI editorial
   team wanted me to write about marketing, I wrote this instead (ha).

   Occasionally, I’ll do an interview where someone will ask: “What’s the
   one thing you did that made the greatest impact to where you are at
   now?”

   It’s my favorite question, both because it’s the easiest to answer and
   something that almost no one does. The answer is about setting goals.
   I’ll get to the specific formula below, but first, let’s take a step
   back.

Are You Ready for Content Marketing in 2018? 60+ Predictions

   content-marketing-predictions-2018

   It’s hard to believe that, after 10 years, this will be the last time I
   share my annual list of content marketing predictions for CMI. Not to
   get all sentimental or anything, but looking into the future of our
   industry and anticipating the content and media trends most likely to
   impact our businesses has always been a favorite part of the job … and
   it will be one of CMI’s content experiences I’ll miss the most as I
   retire from CMI this month.

   But, as change is the only constant, it’s time to put the past aside
   and focus on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. And, if
   anyone can help lead the content marketing industry forward and prepare
   you for what’s to come, it’s the group of experts who contributed to
   our 10^th annual e-book of content marketing predictions.

This Week in Content Marketing: Why Won’t CMOs Consider Buying Media
Companies?

   can be found on both iTunes and Stitcher. If you enjoy our show, we
   would love it if you would rate it or post a review on iTunes.

In this week’s episode

   In this final regular episode, Robert ponders the nature of doing
   nothing (and doing it well). We discuss which company we feel is most
   likely to buy Fox, and whether Apple will ever really buy Disney. We
   also examine an increasingly disturbing web content trend, and media
   companies’ rush into the agency services business. Our rants and raves
   include net neutrality and audio content; then we sign off with an
   example of the week that takes us back to our own humble roots.

In this week’s episode

   This week, Robert ponders the nature of “violent agreement.” We unpack
   the latest content marketing spending research – and debate whether or
   not we can actually believe it. Marketing predictions are back again,
   and we also discuss why Casper is putting Van Winkle’s to sleep. Our
   rants and raves include building an audience, Snapchat, and the art of
   questioning; then we close the show with an example of the week on the
   Maxwell House Haggadah.

17 Questions to Break Free From Competitive Content Issues

   competitive-content In 1998, I became the investment club guide for
   About.com. My responsibilities included the creation of at least one
   original article per week on the topic of investing or investment
   clubs, as well as development of the e-newsletter for the subscribers
   of that channel.

   I absolutely loved it. Every piece of content I created scored more
   traffic. The formula seemed so easy … just create article after article
   answering questions about investment clubs and the audience grew and
   grew.

   About.com had hundreds of guides like me covering almost every topic
   imaginable. By the early 2000s, About.com was one of the largest
   websites (by audience traffic) in the world. At that time, it was all
   about scale … creating content for everybody. Yahoo did it. Microsoft
   did it. Excite.com did it (I owned stock in that little disaster).

   It was about scale until it wasn’t about scale.

This Week in Content Marketing: Is There a Crisis in Content Marketing?

   Robert Rose can be found on both iTunes and Stitcher. If you enjoy our
   show, we would love it if you would rate it or post a review on iTunes.

In this week’s episode

   This week, Robert ponders how we handle filling big shoes. We discuss
   recent reader revenue moves from CNN and the Guardian, and why Facebook
   may have nothing to fear from ad blockers. In other news, we debate
   whether content marketing is in crisis or on the verge of its biggest
   opportunity yet. Our rants and raves cover audience building and how
   the flight to video could hurt publishers; then we close with an
   example of the week on the Electric Boat Company.
