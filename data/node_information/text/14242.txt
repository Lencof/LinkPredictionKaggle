Augmenting the Classroom

   Evolving Education Though Virtual Field-Trips. Perhaps the most
   impressive thing about the Pokemon Go phenomenon is its speed; in a
   week, it was used more than Twitter.  It was an idea the world was
   ready for, packaged in a form that was easily approachable.  It speaks
   to the acceptance we already have of the digital…

How to Save the Environment by Letting Kids Destroy It

   This year’s Earth Day has given us a chance to reflect how the

   permanently destroyed, resulting in server-wide perma death.  What’s
   more, the reason it’s destroyed would be the…

   What do you know about the Oregon Trail?  I’m willing to be that your
   knowledge on the subject is gained almost entirely from the

Our goal at Strange Loop Games is to use the massive power of today’s
hardware for gameplay, not just graphics. We use deep, interactive
simulations to explore the boundaries of what can be done within a game.
