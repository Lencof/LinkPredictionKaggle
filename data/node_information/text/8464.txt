   ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - AUGUST 04: In this aerial view icebergs float at
   the mouth of the Ilulissat Icefjord during a week of unseasonably warm
   weather on August 4, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland. The Sahara heat
   wave that recently sent temperatures to record levels in parts of
   Europe has also reached Greenland. Climate change is having a profound
   effect in Greenland, where over the last several decades summers have
   become longer and the rate that glaciers and the Greenland ice cap are
   retreating has accelerated. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)

   built near Bridgwater on October 1, 2018 in Somerset, England.
   According to the firm building the Somerset nuclear power station, it
   is firmly on track for its next major construction milestone. The
   construction of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by EDF Energy
   began two years ago and it is expected to provide 7% of the UK's
   electricity needs for 60 years when it is switched on in 2025. More
   than 3,200 people are currently on site building the power station near
   Bridgwater, which will be Britain's first power plant in 20 years, and
   is being built adjacent to the existing Hinkley Point A and B nuclear
   power stations and the Bristol channel. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty
