ComputeCpp v1.1.6: Changes to Work-item Mapping Optimization

       November 18, 2019 opencl, sycl    Codeplay Software Limited

   ComputeCpp v1.1.6: Changes to Work-item Mapping Optimization

   In ComputeCpp v1.1.6–Codeplay’s implementation of the open standard
   SYCL–Codeplay introduces an optimization to the way SYCL work-items map
   to OpenCL processing elements in order to improve performance in the
   most common use cases. This blog post will start by providing an
   overview of what has changed and if and how you may need to update your
   SYCL code.

Codeplay announces Acoran, with SYCL, OpenCL and Vulkan at the core of the
platform

   Codeplay announces Acoran, with SYCL, OpenCL and Vulkan at the core of
   the platform

   Codeplay Software announces Acoran, the standards based platform for AI
   programmers. Acoran is compatible with Khronos compute standards and
   Intel’s oneAPI platform, enabling AI processor solutions to align with
   application developers by taking advantage of established standards and
   libraries. Codeplay has developed the Acoran platform based on the most
   relevant and preferred standards, with a comprehensive set of libraries
   that give AI developers an assured feature set for their applications.
   With strong momentum in Khronos standards in the industry, SYCL, OpenCL
   and Vulkan are at the core of the platform, with further support that
   includes these open source projects.

Vulkan Releases Extension to Expose Cross-Vendor Performance Metrics

   Vulkan Releases Extension to Expose Cross-Vendor Performance Metrics

   The Vulkan Working Group has just released the VK_KHR_performance_query
   extension, which provides a cross-vendor common mechanism to expose
   performance metrics. These may be used to obtain data from a Vulkan
   device, typically a graphics card or SoC, to measure the workload
   demand and assess the impact of application modifications and
   optimizations.

   Intel Fact Sheet: oneAPI with SYCL from Khronos

   ​Back in June 2019 Intel launched oneAPI - a single, unified
   programming model that aims to simplify development across multiple
   architectures – such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and accelerators. This
   weekend, Intel posted a fact sheet on oneAPI. Learn more about Intel’s
   oneAPI, why oneAPI is an open specification, what is included in the
   specification, what Data Parallel C++ is, and how does SYCL fit in, in
   the fact sheet.

   SYCL Takes Center Stage at SC19

   SuperComputing (SC19) is the largest gathering of high performance
   computing experts in the world and it kicks off this weekend, Sunday,
   November 17 in Denver, CO. To kick off the conference, the Fifth
   International Workshop on Heterogeneous High-Performance Reconfigurable
   Computing (H2RC 2019) will host two presentations on Sunday
   solely-focused on SYCL, the Khronos open standard language for C++
   single-source heterogeneous programming for OpenCL. The keynote
   delivered by Ronan Keryell from Khronos member, Xilinx and will outline
   the benefits of using SYCL for FPGA programming in a talk entitled
   “SYCL: A Single-Source C++ Standard for Heterogeneous Computing.” Later
   in the morning at 11:00am Michael Kinsner and John Freeman from Intel
   will present “Data Flow Pipes: A SYCL Extension for Spatial
   Architectures,” describing the pipes extension that enables a more
   usable and flexible interface.

The Khronos Group forms Analytic Rendering Exploratory Group – Call for
Participation

       November 13, 2019 exploratory, analyticrendering

   The Khronos Group has issued a call for participation in the newly
   formed Analytic Rendering Exploratory Group. The group has been formed
   to discuss the standardization of an Analytic Rendering API for data
   visualization. All interested parties are invited to participate, with
   no cost or IP obligations, to share perspectives, requirements and use
   cases to help determine whether there is an industry need for such an
   API and to help set the direction for any standardization activities.
   Learn more about what Analytic Rendering is why a new analytic
   rendering API is needed and what the goals of such a group might look
   like. If your company, or a company you know is interested in learning
   more and joining the Exploratory Group, you are invited to contact us.
