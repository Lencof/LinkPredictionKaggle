Abstract

   We have obtained the first data demonstrating the capability of
   multicellular organisms for longterm cryobiosis in permafrost deposits
   of the Arctic. The viable soil nematodes Panagrolaimus aff.
   detritophagus (Rhabditida) and Plectus aff. parvus (Plectida) were
   isolated from the samples of Pleistocene permafrost deposits of the
   Kolyma River Lowland. The duration of natural cryopreservation of the
   nematodes corresponds to the age of the deposits, 30 000–40 000 years.

Abstract

   This paper presents a global scale assessment of the impact of climate
   change on water scarcity. Patterns of climate change from 21 Global
   Climate Models (GCMs) under four SRES scenarios are applied to a global
   hydrological model to estimate water resources across 1339 watersheds.
   The Water Crowding Index (WCI) and the Water Stress Index (WSI) are
   used to calculate exposure to increases and decreases in global water
   scarcity due to climate change. 1.6 (WCI) and 2.4 (WSI) billion people
   are estimated to be currently living within watersheds exposed to water
   scarcity. Using the WCI, by 2050 under the A1B scenario, 0.5 to 3.1
   billion people are exposed to an increase in water scarcity due to
   climate change (range across 21 GCMs). This represents a higher
   upper-estimate than previous assessments because scenarios are
   constructed from a wider range of GCMs. A substantial proportion of the
   uncertainty in the global-scale effect of climate change on water
   scarcity is due to uncertainty in the estimates for South Asia and East
   Asia. Sensitivity to the WCI and WSI thresholds that define water
   scarcity can be comparable to the sensitivity to climate change
   pattern. More of the world will see an increase in exposure to water
   scarcity than a decrease due to climate change but this is not
   consistent across all climate change patterns. Additionally,
   investigation of the effects of a set of prescribed global mean
   temperature change scenarios show rapid increases in water scarcity due
   to climate change across many regions of the globe, up to 2 °C,
   followed by stabilisation to 4 °C.

1 Introduction

   Water scarcity is a major global issue. Existing pressures on water
   resources will be exacerbated by increases in population and also by
   climate change. Various studies have explored how both these factors
   might affect global water scarcity in the future by using population
   projections and simulated changes in climate from global climate models
   (GCMs) with water resources models (Alcamo et al. 2007; Arnell 2004;
   Arnell et al. 2011; Gosling et al. 2010; Hayashi et al. 2010; Oki and
   Kanae 2006).

   Most of this work acknowledges that projections of water scarcity are
   dependent upon not only scenarios of population change and emissions,
   but also the number of GCMs used for simulating the future climate.
   There are over 20 GCMs included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset (Meehl et al. 2007a), which
   all simulate different but plausible climates under identical emissions
   scenarios (Meehl et al. 2007b). Previous global assessments of the
   impact of climate change on water scarcity have used various numbers of
   CMIP3 GCMs ranging from one to six (Arnell 2004; Hayashi et al. 2010).
   Additional uncertainty can arise from the measure used to define water
   scarcity (Alcamo et al. 2007).

   This paper presents the most comprehensive global-scale assessment to
   date of the impact of climate change on water scarcity.
   “Comprehensiveness” is interpreted as taking account of the various
   factors that affect climate change impacts assessment, including; the
   range of possible future climates projected by different GCMs, the
   different magnitudes of possible climate change due to different
   emissions trajectories, different population projections and water
   withdrawals, and differing methods for estimating water scarcity. To
   achieve this, we use climate change patterns from 21 CMIP3 GCMs, four
   socio-economic and emissions scenarios, and two different measures of
   water scarcity. We only use a single hydrological model, however, so we
   do not sample hydrological modelling uncertainty.

   The overarching aim of the paper is to assess how our more
   comprehensive estimates of global water scarcity compare to previous
   assessments. Additionally, in light of The Copenhagen Accord and Durban
   Platform, which state ambitions of limiting the increase in global mean
   temperature to 2 °C and 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial value
   respectively, we assess how different amounts of global mean warming up
   to 4 °C might affect global water scarcity.

2 Methodology

2.1 Introduction

   The experimental design involved applying the patterns of climate
   change from 21 GCMs to a global hydrological model to calculate average
   annual runoff, which in turn was used to estimate global water scarcity
   with a water resources model.

2.2 Climate change scenarios

   Two types of scenarios are considered for each of the 21 GCMs; 1) four
   SRES emissions scenarios (B1, B2, A1B and A2) for three 30-year time
   horizons centred on 2020, 2050 and 2080; and 2) seven prescribed
   changes in global mean temperature relative to present (0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
   2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 °C of 30-year duration each). The current climate
   is characterised by the CRU TS3.1 data set (Harris et al. 2012) for the
   1961–1990 time horizon, which is approximately 0.3 °C above
   pre-industrial.

   Spatial and temporal climate change scenarios at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution
   were constructed by pattern-scaling output from 21 CMIP3 GCMs (Meehl et
   al. 2007a) with ClimGen (Todd et al. 2011). ClimGen uses the change
   pattern for any given GCM to perturb a historical dataset (CRU TS3.1 in
   this study) to ensure minimal bias with respect to observations. This
   is often referred to as the delta method (Arnell and Gosling 2013).
   Further details on pattern-scaling and the 21 GCMs we used are in
   Online Resource 1 in the Electronic Supplementary Materials (ESM) file.
   Not all 21 GCMs are independent of each other and they are considered
   equally plausible in this analysis. To help explore the effects of
   using different GCMs, we selected HadCM3 as an illustrative ‘marker’
   GCM, which presents a plausible characterisation of the spatial
   variability of change in climate (Arnell et al. 2013).

2.3 The global hydrological model and water resources model

   Simulations of average annual runoff across the global domain at a
   spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°, for every climate change pattern and
   scenario, were performed with an established global hydrological model,
   Mac-PDM.09 (Gosling and Arnell 2011). Mac-PDM.09 is used in several
   recent studies (Arnell and Gosling 2013; Arnell et al. 2013; Hagemann
   et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2013). Further details about Mac-PDM.09
   are included in Online Resource 2.

   The runoff simulations from Mac-PDM.09 were applied to a water
   resources model (Arnell et al. 2011; Gosling et al. 2010) to estimate
   water scarcity. For every climate change pattern we calculated two
   well-known measures of water scarcity (Rockström et al. 2009; Oki and
   Kanae 2006); 1) “Water Crowding Index” (WCI; a measure of the annual
   water resources per capita in a watershed) and 2) “The Water Stress
   Index” (WSI; a measure of the ratio of water withdrawals to resources).
   A WCI threshold of <1,000 m^3/capita/year and a WSI of >0.4 were used
   to indicate exposure to water scarcity (Rockström et al. 2009). For
   both measures, available water resource in each of 1339 watersheds
   across the globe was calculated by summing simulated average annual
   runoff from each 0.5° × 0.5° grid cell within a given watershed. WCI is
   heavily dependent upon population size while the WSI accounts for
   variations in withdrawals across watersheds and therefore tends to
   highlight pressures in watersheds with large amounts of irrigation.
   The water resources model calculates four metrics (Arnell et al. 2011)
   that isolate the sole impact of future climate change on water scarcity
   (i.e. they represent the additional impact of climate change on top of
   population and/or withdrawals pressure). This involves calculating
   first, future water scarcity in the absence of climate change (i.e. due
   to future population and/or withdrawals pressure only) and then
   subtracting this from the water scarcity that occurs due to the
   combined effects of future climate change and population and/or
   withdrawals pressure. The four metrics are:
    1. 1)
       The number of people in a region who live in watersheds with no
       water scarcity in the absence of climate change but that enter
       water scarcity due to climate change.

    2. 2)
       The number of people in a region who live in watersheds with water
       scarcity in the absence of climate change but that move out of
       water scarcity due to climate change.

    3. 3)
       The number of people in a region living in watersheds with water
       scarcity in the absence of climate change who see a “significant”
       decrease in runoff due to climate change.

    4. 4)
       The number of people in a region living in watersheds with water
       scarcity in the absence of climate change who see a “significant”
       increase in runoff due to climate change but who still remain in
       water scarcity.

   A “significant” change in runoff is defined to be greater than the
   standard deviation of average annual runoff due to natural
   multi-decadal climatic variability. This was calculated from multiple
   estimates of the 30-year average annual runoff using climate scenarios
   constructed from a long unforced simulation with the HadCM3 climate
   change pattern (Arnell and Gosling 2013).

   For each of the two water scarcity measures, the impact of climate
   change on exposure to water scarcity (i.e. on top of future population
   and/or withdrawals pressure) is summarised by summing 1) and 3) to
   characterise population exposed to a potential increase in water
   scarcity due to climate change, and summing 2) and 4) to characterise
   population with a potential reduction in water scarcity due to climate
   change. Throughout the manuscript, for conciseness, these are referred
   to as an “increase in scarcity” and a “decrease in scarcity”,
   respectively, and the estimates for each can be considered as relative
   to the situation in the future (e.g. 2050) where there is higher
   population and withdrawals than present.

2.4 Socio-economic scenarios

   When exploring water scarcity due to climate change under SRES
   scenarios, future population was taken from the IMAGE v2.3
   representation of the B1, B2, A1B and A2 storylines (Van Vuuren et al.
   2007) and used with the appropriate runoff simulations in the water
   scarcity model. When exploring the prescribed warming scenarios, future
   population was assumed to be equivalent to that under SRES A1B for the
   30-year time horizon centred on 2050, because these climate projections
   are not associated with any specific time in the future or SRES
   scenario. Withdrawals were estimated by rescaling Shen et al.’s (2008)
   projections to match the population projections used here. Note that
   different projections of future withdrawals would give different
   indications of future water resources scarcity.

   Watershed population exposure to water scarcity was aggregated to the
   national scale and then to the regional scale, so water scarcity can be
   expressed regionally in absolute (millions of people) and relative (as
   a percentage of regional population) terms. The countries included in
   each region are listed in Online Resource 3 and displayed in a map in
   Online Resource 4.

3 Results

3.1 Water scarcity in the absence of climate change

   In the year 2000, depending on the measure of water scarcity, 1.6 (25 %
   of global population) and 2.4 billion (39 %) people are estimated to be
   living in watersheds exposed to water scarcity (Table 1). The greatest
   proportions of populations living in water-scarce watersheds are
   located in East Asia (660 and 666 million) and South Asia (491 and
   1004). More people fall into the water scarcity category with the WSI
   than with the WCI (Table 1; see also Online Resource 5 for global
   maps). Notable regions where the two water scarcity measures result in
   opposing results (i.e. one measure results in water scarcity and the
   other measure does not), include parts of the US and Australasia.

   Please refer to Online Resource 3 and Online Resource 4 for details of
   the regional classification

   Total global population in the years 2000, 2020, 2050 and 2080, under
   the A1B scenario, is estimated to be 6.1, 7.3, 8.2 and 7.8 billion
   respectively. This places pressures on future water resources and in
   the absence of climate change it is estimated that by 2050 under A1B,
   3.1 (37 %) and 4.3 billion (53 %) people will be living in watersheds
   exposed to water scarcity, globally. The greatest absolute exposure to
   water scarcity is in South Asia (1.5 and 1.7 billion) and East Asia
   (0.7 and 1.2 billion).

3.2 Runoff changes

   Simulated changes in average annual runoff by 2050 from Mac-PDM.09,
   when it is forced with the pattern of climate change from the HadCM3
   GCM only under A1B, show runoff increases relative to present
   (1961–1990) across large areas of East Asia (+30 %), South Asia
   (+30 %), the high northern latitudes (+40 %), and East Africa (+20 %)
   (see Online Resource 6(a)). Some areas see up to +90 % increases in
   runoff. Changes in runoff in South Asia and East Asia reflect large
   changes in climate on a large regional runoff volume seen in the
   present climate. Declines in runoff are simulated for Brasil (−60 %),
   South America (−30 %), Southern Africa (−40 %), Western Europe (−20 %)
   and Central Europe (−30 %).

   In line with previous assessments (Gosling et al. 2010; Milly et al.
   2005), there is high consistency that runoff decreases with climate
   change across central Europe and that it increases in the high northern
   latitudes but there is less agreement between all CMIP3 model climate
   change patterns across many regions of the globe, including parts of
   South Asia and East Asia (see Online Resource 6(b)). There is little
   change in the pattern of consistency when different time horizons (2020
   and 2080) or scenarios (B1, B2, A2) are considered (not displayed).

3.3 Water scarcity due to climate change only under SRES scenarios

   Regions of the globe experience both increases and decreases in water
   scarcity in the future due to the sole effects of climate change (see
   Fig. 1; expressed as a percentage of future regional population, and
   Online Resource 7; expressed in millions of people). We present the
   estimates associated with each climate change pattern and the range
   across the ensemble but we do not calculate any measures of central
   tendency because these can be an unreliable summary indicator of
   climate change impacts (Gosling et al. 2012). Tables that present the
   absolute and relative values displayed in Fig. 1 are presented in
   Online Resources 8–11). In Fig. 1, an increase in water scarcity of
   100 % for a region would mean that in 2050, 100 % of the people living
   in watersheds in that region experience an increase in water scarcity
   that is attributable solely to climate change (i.e. the increase is not
   due to changes in population or withdrawals; it is additional to them).
   A number of general conclusions can be drawn from these results.
   Open image in new window Fig. 1
   Fig. 1

   Exposure to an increase and decrease in water scarcity attributable
   solely to climate change (i.e. the increases and decreases are
   additional to the effects of changes in future population or
   withdrawals), expressed as a percentage of future regional population,
   at 2050, using the WCI (1,000 m^3/capita/year) and the WSI (0.4). The
   individual markers denote estimates for individual GCMs, with a
   different marker shape assigned to each SRES scenario. Filled red
   circles denote the HadCM3 GCM. The vertical grey bars denote the range
   across 21 GCMs

   When considering all CMIP3 models together, a greater global population
   experience an increase in water scarcity due to climate change than a
   decrease, but this is not necessarily the case for individual models.
   In 2050 and under A1B, an increase in water scarcity is experienced
   globally by 0.5 to 3.1 billion (WCI) and 0.8 to 3.9 billion (WSI); a
   decrease is experienced by 0.2 to 2.2 and 0.1 to 2.7 billion for each
   water scarcity measure respectively. This is consistent across SRES
   scenarios as well as the two measures of water scarcity. However, this
   result does not hold for every individual CMIP3 model. For example,
   with the HadCM3 pattern more people are exposed to a decrease in
   scarcity (1.9 and 2.7 billion) than an increase (1.0 and 1.3) by 2050.

   In absolute terms, uncertainty in the effects of climate change on
   water scarcity due to the application of all CMIP3 models is greatest
   for South Asia and East Asia. Here, by 2050 and under the A1B scenario,
   between 52–1460 million and 0–506 million people are exposed to
   increased water scarcity respectively, when using the WCI. If these two
   estimates are expressed as a fraction of the total global population,
   then South Asia and East Asia account for 1–18 % and 0–6 % respectively
   of the global population exposed to increased water scarcity due to
   climate change. Thus a substantial proportion of the uncertainty in the
   global-scale effect of climate change on water scarcity is due to
   uncertainties in estimating the effects in South Asia and East Asia.
   Close investigation of Fig. 2 explains why this uncertainty range is so
   large for South Asia and East Asia and also why it is greater for the
   WSI than the WCI. While the application of a single GCM (HadCM3)
   indicates that some watersheds in East Asia move out of water scarcity
   and/or see a decrease due to climate change, when using all CMIP3
   models around 4–10/21 simulations indicate that water scarcity
   increases in these watersheds and around 11–14/21 show a decease in
   scarcity. Climate change affects more watersheds in East Asia when
   using the WSI than the WCI, which means the uncertainty across
   simulations showing increases and decreases in water scarcity translate
   into a larger uncertainty range in absolute terms.

   Fig. 2

   The effect of climate change only on exposure to water scarcity in 2050
   under the SRES A1B scenario, using the WCI (1,000 m^3/capita/year; left
   panels) and the WSI (0.4; right panels). Top panels display the change
   in scarcity classes with the HadCM3 GCM only. The other panels show
   consistency across 21 simulations (with all CMIP3 models), in terms of
   the number of simulations out of 21 that show an increase in exposure
   (indicative of where there is an increase in scarcity or a watershed
   moves into water scarcity; middle panels), or decreases (a decrease in
   scarcity or move out of scarcity; bottom panels)

   The differences in projections of water scarcity across the four
   scenarios are relatively small when compared with the differences
   across the 21 simulations. Globally, the absolute (relative) increases
   in scarcity by 2050 with HadCM3, when using the WCI are 1.0 (13 %), 1.0
   (12 %), 1.1 (12 %) and 1.4 billion (14 %), for A1B, B1, B2 and A2
   respectively. By comparison, the minimum and maximum values across the
   21 simulations for absolute (relative) increases in scarcity by 2050
   and using the same scarcity measure are 0.5 and 3.1 (6 and 38 %), 0.5
   and 2.8 (6 and 34 %), 0.6 and 3.5 (6 and 39 %), and 0.7 and 4.7 billion
   (7 and 46 %) for A1B, B1, B2 and A2 respectively. This means that the
   range across the 21 simulations with all CMIP3 models for a single
   scenario (e.g. A1B) is greater than the range across all four emissions
   scenarios for a single GCM (HadCM3). This is observed at both the
   global-scale and at the regional-scale.

3.4 Sensitivity to the WCI and WSI thresholds for water scarcity

   So far we have described exposure to water scarcity due to climate
   change based upon the two measures of water scarcity (WCI and WSI) with
   scarcity indicator thresholds of <1,000 m^3/capita/year and >0.4
   respectively. A more rigorous analysis of the sensitivity of water
   scarcity exposure to the scarcity measure compares scarcity indicator
   thresholds (500, 1,000, 1,700 m^3/capita/year and 0.1, 0.2, 0.4
   respectively) (see Fig. 3 for relative exposure and Online Resource 12
   for absolute exposure). These thresholds, which are arbitrary, have
   been used previously with the WCI for defining “extreme water shortage”
   (<500), “chronic water shortage” (<1000) and “moderate water shortage”
   (<1700) (Kummu et al. 2010; Arnell 2004) and with the WSI for defining
   “low stress” (>0.1), “medium stress” (>0.2) and “high stress” (>0.4)
   (Arnell 1999). This analysis demonstrates how sensitive estimates of
   water scarcity are to the selection of arbitrary thresholds.

   Fig. 3

   Comparison of WCI and WSI water scarcity measure thresholds. Exposure
   to an increase or decrease in water scarcity due to climate change is
   expressed as a percentage of regional future population in 2050,
   assuming the A1B scenario

   The sensitivity of exposure to the three thresholds for each measure is
   appreciable. Generally, it is greater than sensitivity of exposure to
   SRES scenario but slightly less than sensitivity to climate change
   pattern. For example, the estimated increase in global exposure to
   water scarcity by 2050 under A1B and using the WCI
   (1,000 m^3/capita/year) is 0.5 to 3.1 billion (6–38 %) across all CMIP3
   models, while it is 0.5 to 1.5 billion (6–18 %) across the three WCI
   thresholds with HadCM3. This compares with 1.0 to 1.4 billion (12–14 %)
   across the four SRES scenarios with HadCM3. For some regions the
   sensitivity to indicator is comparable to sensitivity to climate change
   pattern (Central Asia and Central Europe).

3.5 Water scarcity due to climate change only under prescribed warming
scenarios

   Exposure to water scarcity, as measured with the WCI, increases
   non-linearly with global mean temperature and there are clear overlaps
   between the ranges for increases and decreases in exposure across CMIP3
   models (as observed under the SRES scenarios) in relative (Fig. 4) and
   absolute (Online Resource 13) terms. Exposure to water scarcity
   increases steeply up to 2 °C in many regions (North Africa, East
   Africa, Mashriq, Arabian Peninsula and South Asia) and then stabilises
   by 4 °C. This is because by this point all the watersheds that see a
   decrease in precipitation experience a significant decrease; beyond
   this point there are no further areas where precipitation decreases
   significantly. With a higher threshold for the definition of
   ‘significant’ change, the limit would obviously occur at a higher
   global mean temperature. Global exposure to an increase (decrease) in
   water scarcity with HadCM3 by 2050 and assuming A1B for 1, 2, 3 and
   4 °C prescribed warming, is 760 (1807), 973 (1872), 1055 (1897) and
   1161 (1905) million people respectively, but the uncertainty range
   across all CMIP3 models is considerable.

4 Discussion and conclusions

   Our estimate of present-day populations living within watersheds
   exposed to water scarcity (1.6 and 2.4 billion) is consistent with
   other studies that have published estimates around 2.4 billion (Oki and
   Kanae 2006), 1.4 and 2.2 billion (Arnell 2004), 1.7 and 2.3 billion
   (Revenga et al. 2000), 1.6 and 2.4 billion (Arnell et al. 2011), 1.2
   billion (Hayashi et al. 2010), and 1.6 and 2.3 billion (Alcamo et al.
   2007); the ranges are due to the application of different measures of
   water scarcity. By 2050, the effects of population increases alone mean
   that 3.1 and 4.3 billion people (37 and 53 %) will be living in
   watersheds exposed to water scarcity, which is similar to previous
   estimates around 3.4 and 5.6 billion (39 and 48 %) (Arnell 2004), 3.7
   and 4.2 billion (42 and 47 %) (Arnell et al. 2011), and 3.8 billion
   (40 %) (Hayashi et al. 2010).

   Direct comparisons of projected changes in exposure to water scarcity
   with other studies is not straightforward because of the application of
   different climate models, emissions and population scenarios,
   hydrological models, and measures of water scarcity. An additional
   issue that complicates inter-study comparisons is the spatial scale at
   which water scarcity is calculated. We estimated watershed population
   exposure to water scarcity and aggregated this to the national scale
   and then to the regional scale. Alternative approaches have conducted
   analyses at the scale of individual grid cells (Oki and Kanae 2006;
   Vörösmarty et al. 2000), countries (Oki et al. 2001) and food
   production units (Kummu et al. 2010). While the above comparisons do
   not account for these differences, a tentative comparison can be made,
   however, with two studies that both used a previous version of the
   hydrological model we applied and a WCI threshold of
   1,000 m^3/capita/year to define water scarcity at the watershed scale
   (then aggregating to country and regional scales). Arnell (2004)
   calculated a global increase in exposure (in billions of people) by
   2055 under A2 of 1.1 to 2.8, across 6 GCMS. Our estimates by 2050 under
   A2 are 0.7 to 4.7, across 21 GCMs. Arnell et al. (2011) used a
   “Reference” scenario that is comparable to A1B and calculated a global
   increase in exposure by 2050 of 0.5 to 1.5 billion across 4 GCMs. Our
   estimate under A1B is 0.5 to 3.1 billion, across 21 GCMs.

   Compared with these two studies, our estimates present a wider range
   that encapsulates both, but with very little difference at the
   lower-end and a considerable increase at the upper-end (over 1 billion
   people). This is because our assessment considered many more patterns
   of climate change from GCMs than either of the two studies. Some of the
   GCMs we used will simulate lower precipitation with climate change than
   those used by Arnell (2004) and Arnell et al. (2011). In absolute
   terms, uncertainty in the effects of climate change on water scarcity
   due to the application of all CMIP3 models is greatest for South Asia
   and East Asia, since these are two regions where GCMs show large
   differences in the magnitude, and sometimes sign, of precipitation
   change (Meehl et al. 2007b), and hence runoff change. Thus a
   substantial proportion of the uncertainty in the global-scale effect of
   climate change on water scarcity is due to uncertainties in estimating
   the effects in South Asia and East Asia.

   The shape of the distribution of exposure across all CMIP3 models
   varies by region and type of exposure. This means that climate change
   impacts studies should try to use climate change projections from an
   ensemble of climate models that best represent the range across all
   GCMs available. It is not always computationally feasible to use all
   members of an ensemble (e.g. the CMIP3 models), however, and in such
   cases a careful and thoughtful selection of GCMs should be made, e.g.
   by considering where each GCM sits on the range of all GCMs in the
   ensemble. Otherwise there is a risk of selecting only GCMs that
   represent either the tail, or part of a bimodal distribution, for
   instance, and thus underestimating or overestimating the range of
   possible outcomes. While GCM performance metrics present a method for
   the selection of GCMs in impact studies (Wilby 2010), there remains a
   strong argument that all available GCMs should be used regardless
   because there is no difference in the projections from “better” GCMs
   when compared with “weaker” GCMs, at least where precipitation
   projections are of relevance (Chiew et al. 2009). Moreover, no single
   GCM may consistently out-perform all others when variables beyond
   precipitation only are considered (Gleckler et al. 2008).

   We found that some climate change patterns result in more people
   exposed to an increase in water scarcity than people exposed to a
   decrease, at the global-scale (note that a “net water scarcity change”
   cannot be calculated by summing the increase and decrease in exposure
   for the reasons outlined by Arnell et al. (2011)). This contrasts with
   previous studies that used many less climate change patterns than we
   applied here and found consistently that a greater proportion of the
   global population is exposed to a decrease in water scarcity than an
   increase (Arnell 2004; Hayashi et al. 2010). The sensitivity of
   relative increases and decreases in exposure to climate change pattern
   adds weight to the argument that all available GCMs should be used in
   water resource climate change impact assessments, where possible.

   Similar to earlier work (Gosling et al. 2010; Arnell 2004), we found
   that projections of water scarcity are substantially more sensitive to
   climate change pattern than emissions scenario. However, this
   assessment has highlighted an appreciable sensitivity to the water
   scarcity indicator threshold that is used. Moreover, this is an
   important caveat of our analysis, since all estimates of water scarcity
   presented here are based upon global-scale generalisations about what
   it means to be in a situation of water scarcity. In particular, the
   application of the WSI is traditionally based upon water withdrawals
   instead of actual consumption. To some extent, this could mean that
   water scarcity measured by the WSI is overestimated in watersheds where
   withdrawn water is predominantly used either several times (e.g.
   hydropower) or returned downstream for other users instead of being
   consumed (e.g. some parts of the US). However, this limitation is less
   relevant to locations where water withdrawals are used predominantly
   for irrigation, where the water is also consumed and not returned to
   the system.

   Average annual runoff was used as input to the water resources model.
   Thus in our modelling approach, an increase in average annual runoff
   can benefit society through a decrease in water scarcity. On the other
   hand, however, this could be tempered by an increase in flood risk,
   which we did not consider in this study, but we have elsewhere (Arnell
   and Gosling 2013). Other caveats include assumptions involving the
   parameters used both in the pattern-scaling (Todd et al. 2011) and
   Mac-PDM.09 (Gosling and Arnell 2011), and the assumed rates of
   population change (for each SRES scenario only one population
   projection was used). Additionally, by using a single global
   hydrological model we considerably underestimated hydrological model
   uncertainty, which only recently has been shown to be appreciable
   (Hagemann et al. 2013) but we note that Haddeland et al. (2011) showed
   that under present-day climate forcing, Mac-PDM.09 was located towards
   the middle of the range in simulated runoff across 5 global
   hydrological models. The net effect of these caveats is that the
   estimates of exposure to water scarcity should not to be taken too
   literally as actual impacts or “hardship” but rather as an indication
   of the relative effects of different emissions, climate and population
   scenarios.

   We conducted this assessment at a time when a new set of global change
   scenarios was being released; the GCMs of CMIP5 (Taylor et al. 2011)
   with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; van Vuuren et al.
   (2011)) and the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs; Kriegler et al.
   (2012)). A comparison of our CMIP3 SRES A2 simulations to CMIP5 RCP8.5
   SSP3 (see Online Resource 14 for methods and results) suggests that our
   conclusions are robust across the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models because the
   estimates of water scarcity are broadly consistent.

Abstract

   Previous research has postulated that climate change will lead to mass
   migration. However, the linkages postulated between the two have not
   been explicitly demonstrated but have rather been derived from ‘common
   sense’. In this paper, the connection between climate change and
   migration via two mechanisms, sea level rise and floods, is
   investigated and depicted in conceptual models. In both cases, a
   connection can be traced and the linkages are made explicit. However,
   the study also clearly shows that the connection is by no means
   deterministic but depends on numerous factors relating to the
   vulnerability of the people and the region in question.

Abstract

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has
   estimated that in 2010–2012, 868 million people were undernourished
   worldwide. At the same time, FAO reported that approximately 1.3
   billion tons of food were lost or wasted globally in 2007, which was
   equivalent to approximately one-third of the food produced for human
   consumption at the time. Food losses and waste deprive the poor living
   in developing regions of opportunities to access food, cause
   significant depletion of resources such as land, water, and fossil
   fuels, and increase the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food
   production. In the present study, the effects of reducing food losses
   and waste on global food security, natural resources, and greenhouse
   gas emissions were evaluated using a food trade model operating under
   the assumption that in 2007, developed regions, as defined by the FAO,
   would reduce food losses and waste by up to 50 % during the stages of
   postharvest handling and storage, processing and packaging,
   distribution, and consumption. The results obtained show quantitatively
   that reductions in food losses in developed regions decrease the number
   of undernourished people in developing regions by up to 63 million,
   leading to decreases in the harvested area, water utilization, and
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production.

Appendix 1: Simple method for estimating per capita income change

   The per capita income for region r in the base year 2007, pcINC[
   r,base], is defined as follows:
   $$ {\text{pcINC}}_{\text{r,base}} = {\text{GDE}}_{\text{r,base}}
   /{\text{POP}}_{\text{r, base}} $$
   (1)
   where GDE[r,base] is the GDE and POP[r,base] is the total population in
   the base year.
   After the reduction of food losses and food waste in developed regions,
   per capita income in developing regions, pcINC[r], is recalculated
   simply by revising the GDE[r] as follows:
   $$ {\text{pcINC}}_{\text{r}} = {\text{GDE}}_{\text{r}}
   /{\text{POP}}_{\text{r,base}} $$
   (2)
   $$ \begin{aligned} {\text{GDE}}_{\text{r}} & = \sum\limits_{i} {\left(
   {{\text{AgGDE}}_{{{\text{CN}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}\, { \cdot
   }\,\frac{{{\text{PC}}_{i}\, { \cdot }\,{\text{QF}}_{i}
   }}{{{\text{PC}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}}\, { \cdot
   }\,{\text{QF}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}} \right)} \\ & \quad +
   \sum\limits_{i} {\left(
   {{\text{AgGDE}}_{{{\text{EX}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}\, { \cdot
   }\,\frac{{{\text{PW}}_{i}\, { \cdot }\,{\text{QEX}}_{i}
   }}{{{\text{PW}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}}\, { \cdot
   }\,{\text{QEX}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}} \right)} \\ & \quad -
   \sum\limits_{i} {\left(
   {{\text{AgGDE}}_{{{\text{IM}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}\, { \cdot
   }\,\frac{{{\text{PW}}_{i}\, { \cdot }\,{\text{QIM}}_{i}
   }}{{{\text{PW}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}}\, { \cdot
   }\,{\text{QIM}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}} \right)} +
   {\text{RtGDE}}_{\text{r,base}} \\ \end{aligned} $$
   (3)
   where PC[ i ]and PW[ i ]are consumer and world prices; QF[ i ], QEX[ i
   ]and QIM[ i ]are consumer demand, exports and imports, respectively,
   for food commodity i after the reduction of food losses and food waste
   in developed regions; and AgGDE_CN[ i,base], AgGDE_EX[ i,base], and
   AgGDE_IM[ i,base] are agricultural consumption, exports, and imports,
   respectively, in the base year. RtGDE[r,base] is determined by
   subtracting these agricultural terms from gross domestic expenditure,
   GDE[r,base] values taken from the GTAP8 database (Narayanan et al.
   2012).
   Although the expenditure for the other goods (RtGDE[r]) is assumed to
   be constant at the base year level in the formula (3), it could be
   reduced due to food wastage reduction in developed regions for the
   following two relations. First, RtGDE[r] could be reduced due to the
   price decrease of food considering substitution between food and the
   other goods. Generally, the more substitutable with other goods, the
   more elastic to the price the demand of good tends to be. As is shown
   in Table 13, food demand is less elastic to the price than the other
   goods are, which means food has little substitution goods. Therefore,
   RtGDE[r] might be reduced slightly due to the decreases of food prices
   in developing regions. Secondly, RtGDE[r] could be reduced due to
   agricultural income reduction arising from the decreases of food price
   and food production in developing regions because the other goods are
   more elastic to income than food is (Table 13). Consequently, GDEs
   (GDPs) in developing regions could be reduced further due to the
   decrease of RtGDE[r], which leads to the increase in the number of
   undernourished people for developing regions.

Appendix 2: The FAO methodology for assessing food insecurity: a skew-normal
distributional model

   In 2012, the FAO methodology for estimating the prevalence of
   undernourishment went through a review to choose the most appropriate
   model to describe the dietary energy consumption of the population and
   improve the estimation of its parameters. A skew-normal distribution
   (Azzalini 1985) was adopted as a result of this review (FAO, WFP, IFAD
   2012). In the model, the proportion of undernourished individuals in
   the total population is defined by the following cumulative
   distribution function:
   $$ F({\text{MDER}}) = \varPhi \left( {\frac{{{\text{MDER}} - \xi
   }}{\omega }} \right) - 2\,{\text{Owen}}T\left( {\frac{{{\text{MDER}} -
   \xi }}{\omega },\alpha } \right) $$
   (4)
   where MDER is the minimum dietary energy requirement (kcal/person/day)
   and ω, ξ, and α are scale, location, and shape parameters,
   respectively. Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard
   normal distribution and OwenT is Owen’s T function. These two
   parameters are defined as follows:
   $$ \varPhi (x) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ {1 + {\text{erf}}\left(
   {\frac{x}{\sqrt 2 }} \right)} \right]( - \infty < x < + \infty ) $$
   (5)
   $$ {\text{Owen}}T(h,a) = \frac{1}{2\pi }\int\limits_{0}^{a}
   {\frac{{{\text{e}}^{{ - \frac{1}{2}h^{2} \left( {1 + x^{2} } \right)}}
   }}{{1 + x^{2} }}} {\text{d}}x( - \infty < h,a < + \infty ) $$
   (6)
   where erf is the error function.
   The values of the scale, location, and shape parameters are derived
   from the mean, variance, coefficient of variation (CV), and skewness of
   the distribution and the food loss rate (Loss), as follows:
   $$ {\text{Mean}} = {\text{DES}}{ \cdot }\left( {1 - {\text{Loss}}}
   \right) = \xi + \omega \delta \sqrt {\frac{2}{\pi }\;}\,
   {\text{where}}\;\delta = \frac{\alpha }{{\sqrt {1 + \alpha^{2} } }} $$
   (7)
   $$ {\text{Variance}} = \omega^{2} (1 - (2\delta^{2} )/\pi ) $$
   (8)
   $$ {\text{CV}} = \frac{{\sqrt {\text{Variance}} }}{\text{Mean}} $$
   (9)
   $$ {\text{Skewness}} = \frac{4 - \pi }{2}{ \cdot }\frac{{\left( {\delta
   \sqrt {2/\pi } } \right)^{3} }}{{(1 - 2\delta^{2} /\pi )^{3/2} }} $$
   (10)
   where DES is the average dietary energy supply (kcal/person/day), which
   is computed from the per capita consumption of food commodities
   (kg/person/year) as the outcome of the modified PEATSim model. Finally,
   the number of undernourished people is determined by multiplying the
   proportion of undernourished people by the total population.

Appendix 3: How to calculate the reduction target for food losses and food
waste in developed regions

   In the modified PEATSim model, the regional food balance for each
   commodity in 2007 is expressed as follows:
   $$ {\text{QS}}0 + {\text{QIM}}0 - {\text{QEX}}0 + {\text{QSt}}0 =
   {\text{QL}}0 + {\text{QR}}0 + {\text{QP}}0 + {\text{QE}}0 +
   {\text{QF}}0 $$
   (11)
   where QS0, QIM0, QEX0, and QSt0 on the left-hand side are production,
   import, export, and stock variation, respectively, and QL0, QR0, QE0,
   QP0, and QF0 on the right-hand side are feed, seed, other utility,
   processing, and consumer demand, respectively, derived from the food
   balance sheets in FAOSTAT (FAO 2012).

   In the following formulas for calculating food wastage, QW0 represents
   food losses in the postharvest handling and storage stages in 2007,
   derived from “waste” in the commodity balances in FAOSTAT, which is
   included in the other utility (QE0) in the food balance sheets. QE, QP,
   and QF are the other utility, processing, and consumer demand,
   respectively, in developed regions after reduction of food losses and
   food waste, which are fixed at the reduced levels during simulation
   processes. R [m], R [p], R [d], and R [c] are the ratios of waste
   generation in the milling, processing and packaging, distribution, and
   consumption stages, respectively, in the SIK report (Gustavsson et al.
   2013). R [r] is the target reduction ratio for food losses and food
   waste for all food commodities, which is taken as the maximum of 0.5 in
   the present study. S [QE], S [QP], and S [QF] are the maximum reduction
   quantities for other utility, processing, and consumer demand,
   respectively, in the model.

Cereals

   Food losses and food waste are generated as follows at each stage of
   the food supply chain:

   Postharvest handling and storage: QW0

   Milling: R [m] · QF0

   Processing and packaging: R [p] · QP0 + R [p] · (1 − R [m]) · QF0

   Distribution: R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · (1 − R
   [m]) · QF0

   Consumption: R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [c] · (1 − R
   [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · (1 − R [m]) · QF0

   Therefore, the maximum reduction quantity for each demand is calculated
   as follows:

   Other utility (S [QE]): QW0

   Processing (S [QP]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d])
   · (1 − R [p])] · QP0

   Consumer (S [QF]): [R [m] + R [p] · (1 − R [m]) + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) ·
   (1 − R [m]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · (1 − R [m])] · QF0

Oilseed crops and vegetable oils

   Food losses and food waste are generated as follows at each stage of
   the food supply chain:

   Postharvest handling and storage: QW0[crop]

   Processing and packaging: R [p] · QP0[oil] + R [p]/(1 − R [p]) ·
   QF0[oil]

   Distribution: R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QP0[oil] + R [d] · [1 − R
   [p]/(1 − R [p])] · QF0[oil] + R [d] · QF0[crop]

   Consumption: R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QP0[oil] + R [c] ·
   (1 − R [d]) · [1 − R [p]/(1 − R [p])] · QF0[oil] + R [c] · (1 − R [d])
   · QF0[crop]

   Therefore, the maximum reduction quantity for each demand is calculated
   as follows:

   Other utility (S [QE,crop]): QW0[crop]

   Processing (S [QP,oil]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R
   [d]) · (1 − R [p])] · QP0[oil]

   Consumer (S [QF,oil]): {R [p]/(1 − R [p]) + R [d] · [1 − R [p]/(1 − R
   [p])] + R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · [1 − R [p]/(1 − R [p])]} · QF0[oil]

   Consumer (S [QF,crop]): [R [d] + R [c] · (1 − R [d])] · QF0[crop]

Livestock products

   Food losses and food waste are generated as follows at each stage of
   the food supply chain:

   Postharvest handling and storage: QW0

   Processing and packaging: R [p] · QP0 + R [p] · QF0

   Distribution: R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QF0

   Consumption: R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [c] · (1 − R
   [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QF0

   Therefore, the maximum reduction quantity for each demand is calculated
   as follows:

   Other utility (S [QE]): QW0

   Processing (S [QP]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d])
   · (1 − R [p])] · QP0

   Consumer (S [QF]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d]) ·
   (1 − R [p])] · QF0

   Consequently, other utility, processing, and consumer demands in
   developed regions after reducing food losses and food waste, namely,
   QE, QP, and QF, respectively, amount to (QE0 − R [r] · S [QE]),
   (QP0 − R [r] · S [QP]), and (QF0 − R [r] · S [QF]), respectively, which
   are fixed at these levels during simulation processes.

Abstract

   In two experiments, the claim was tested that the font “Dyslexie”,
   specifically designed for people with dyslexia, eases reading
   performance of children with (and without) dyslexia. Three questions
   were investigated. (1) Does the Dyslexie font lead to faster and/or
   more accurate reading? (2) Do children have a preference for the
   Dyslexie font? And, (3) is font preference related to reading
   performance? In Experiment 1, children with dyslexia (n = 170) did not
   read text written in Dyslexie font faster or more accurately than in
   Arial font. The majority preferred reading in Arial and preference was
   not related to reading performance. In Experiment 2, children with
   (n = 102) and without dyslexia (n = 45) read word lists in three
   different font types (Dyslexie, Arial, Times New Roman). Words written
   in Dyslexie font were not read faster or more accurately. Moreover,
   participants showed a preference for the fonts Arial and Times New
   Roman rather than Dyslexie, and again, preference was not related to
   reading performance. These experiments clearly justify the conclusion
   that the Dyslexie font neither benefits nor impedes the reading process
   of children with and without dyslexia.

   Dyslexia Font Reading

   Dyslexia is a problem with the acquisition of reading decoding and/or
   spelling. These problems are not accompanied by intellectual
   disabilities and remain despite intensive instruction and practice
   (Lyon, Shaywitz, & Shaywitz, 2003). Scientific research that aims at a
   causal explanation for reading and spelling problems (henceforth,
   dyslexia) is omnipresent (Wijnants, Hasselman, Cox, Bosman, & Van
   Orden, 2012). The strongest theoretical perspective on dyslexia is
   problems with phonology (Lyon et al., 2003; Shaywitz, Morris, &
   Shaywitz, 2008; Snowling, 2011; Vellutino & Fletcher, 2005; Vellutino,
   Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004). Phonology refers to the sound of
   spoken words. The ability to read requires the reader to decode each
   letter or letter cluster into its sounds or phonemes. Spelling requires
   the opposite, the segmentation of spoken words into its constituent
   phonemes and recoding them into visual symbols. Most remediation
   techniques, therefore, rely on strengthening phonologically based
   skills and proved to be successful when the approach includes visual
   presentation of written words (Duff & Clarke, 2011; Morais, 1991;
   Pennington, Peterson, & McGrath, 2009; Shaywitz et al., 2008; Snowling
   & Hulme, 2011; Tijms, 2011).

   Although studies on the relationship between phonological skills and
   reading performance are relatively consistent, other research suggests
   a relationship between reading skill and vision (e.g., Irlen & Lass,
   1989; Lovegrove, Martin, & Slaghuis, 1986; Orton, 1937; Stein & Walsh,
   1997). In fact, the first written account on a child who appeared to be
   unable to read was by the British medical doctor Kerr (1897) who
   describes “…a boy with word blindness, who can spell the separate
   letters…” (p. 668). The term word blindness reveals the assumption of a
   visual origin of the reading and spelling problem.

   The most persistent perspective on the relationship between a visual
   problem and reading performance is the magnocellular theory of dyslexia
   (Stein & Walsh, 1997). Visual sensitivity is insufficiently suppressed
   by the magnocellular system when reading, such that fixations from one
   place in the text to the other cannot be distinguished properly.
   Evidence for this assumption is equivocal (Amitay, Ben-Yehudah, Banai,
   & Ahissar, 2002; Stein, 2014; Stein & Walsh, 1997; see Gori & Facoetti,
   2014, for an extensive overview of visual theories and potential,
   albeit debatable, treatments).

   A somewhat older explanation put forward by Irlen and Lass (1989) is
   that poor readers may suffer from the so-called ‘scotopic sensitivity
   syndrome’, which refers to difficulties with a light source, glare,
   luminance, wave length, and black/white contrast. Irlen’s solution was
   to provide readers with tinted glasses or overlays. The evidence for
   the effectiveness of this treatment is also far from conclusive (e.g.,
   Blaskey et al., 1990; Goldstand, Koslowe, & Parush, 2005; Henderson,
   Tsogka, & Snowling, 2013; Irlen & Lass, 1989).

   Yet another reason for poor reading performance has been sought in
   typographical characteristics of text. The fact that children’s books
   for learning to read have a larger font size than books for more
   advanced readers reflects the idea that typographical properties affect
   the reading decoding process (Bernard, Chaparro, Mills, & Halcomb,
   2002; Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011; Wilkins, Cleave, Grayson, & Wilson,
   2009; Woods, Davis, & Scharff, 2005). Legibility is thought to be
   affected by the following font characteristics: x-height, body size,
   character and interline spacing, and shape (i.e., weight, contrast,
   serif or sans serif types, italic, bold etc.). Each will be discussed
   in detail below.

Typographical characteristics

   The body size of a font refers to the height of the letter, measured
   from the lowest point of the descender until the top of the ascender,
   supplemented with a minimal amount of extra space which is needed in
   order to prevent that letters will touch other letters (Legge &
   Bigelow, 2011; Spelbrink, 2012). Font size is measured in points (pt).
   A point is about 0.353 mm or 1/72 of an inch. Fonts with body sizes
   between 9 and 12 points (Bolder et al., 1990) or between 9 and 11
   points (Unger, 2006) are considered to be legible.

   The x-height of a font is the height of the lowercase letter x, given a
   certain point size (Legge & Bigelow, 2011; Spelbrink, 2012). Fonts with
   a relatively large x-height are more legible than fonts with a smaller
   x-height (Bernard et al., 2002; Dobres, Chrysler, Wolfe, Chahine, &
   Reimer, 2017; Legge & Bigelow, 2011; Williams, 2001). Note, however,
   that extreme large or extreme small x-heights might have a negative
   impact on reading performances (Williams, 2001). In children’s books,
   x-height generally decreases with increasing reading age (Hughes &
   Wilkins, 2000).

   The character and interline spacing of a font refer to the space
   between the letters and space between the lines and surrounding texts
   (Unger, 2006). Proportionally spaced fonts are considered to be more
   legible than monospaced (fixed character width; Gelderman, 1998).
   Gianotten (2014a), a Dutch expert in typography, maintains that a
   larger font, extra interline space, and adding extra space between
   letters positively contribute to legibility (see also, Perea, Panadero,
   Moret-Tatay, & Gómez, 2012). Hughes and Wilkins (2000) examined the
   combined effects of x-height, line spacing, word spacing, and line
   length. They found that reading speed of young children (aged 5 to
   7 years) decreased when the size of the text decreased. However,
   reading speed of older children (aged 8 to 11 years) was not affected
   by the size of the texts. For accuracy, they found an effect for all
   age groups; more errors were made on smaller texts compared to larger
   (Hughes & Wilkins, 2000).

   The shape of a font is determined by weight, contrast, being serif or
   sans serif, and italic or regular. Font weight refers to boldness. Font
   contrast is the ratio between thin and thick parts. Serif fonts are
   letters that have small lines added to the edge of letters, such as in
   Times New Roman or Cambria; fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and Calibiri
   are so-called sans serif fonts, because they lack lines trailing of the
   edges. Historically, serif fonts are considered to be more legible than
   sans serif fonts, since serifs make letters more distinguishable
   (McLean, 1980) and because it accentuates the end of the strokes
   (Rubinstein, 1988). Empirical findings concerning the effect on reading
   performances are, however, inconclusive (Gelderman, 1998; Unger, 2006).
   Some studies showed that sans serif fonts benefit reading outcomes
   (Kaspar, Wehlitz, von Knobelsdorff, Wulf, & von Saldern, 2015;
   Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011; Woods et al., 2005). Others showed that
   serifs might only be beneficial for reading when the size of the
   letters is small, probably due to the fact that serif fonts have a
   slightly increased letters space (Arditi & Cho, 2005; Kaspar et al.,
   2015). Finally, we mention that italic or bold fonts may affect
   legibility negatively compared to regular fonts (Bolder et al., 1990;
   Williams, 2001).

   Thus, legibility appears to be affected by a number of different
   characteristics of a font. These characteristics are, however, often
   interrelated. An example is a font that is changed from a regular one
   into an italic one. It is not just the angle of the letters that
   changes, but also the space between the letter; there is often less
   inter-letter space in an italic font than in a regular one. To study
   the effect of each of these properties separately is therefore not
   easy, and perhaps even impossible (Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011;
   Russell-Minda et al., 2007).

   Font characteristics and dyslexia

   Only a few studies have focused on the effects of adjusting texts for
   people with dyslexia. A first conclusion that can be drawn from these
   studies is that font size matters. O’Brien, Mansfield, and Legge (2005)
   argue that children with dyslexia need a larger print size to support
   maximum reading speed compared to children with a typical reading
   development. A second conclusion is that no differences were observed
   in reading times of participants with dyslexia reading texts in sans
   serif or serif fonts (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013). We need to add that
   the mean age of the participants was 20 years with the youngest being
   11 and the oldest 50. The effect of serif may turn out to be different
   for younger children with reading difficulties. The British Dyslexia
   Association (2014) recommends a sans serif font, although they do not
   refer to research to substantiate this advice. A third conclusion is
   that no differences in reading times were found for participants with
   dyslexia when texts were read in regular compared to italic fonts
   (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013). A final conclusion is that children with
   dyslexia may benefit from extra inter-letter spacing (Perea et al.,
   2012; Zorzi et al., 2012), but seem not to benefit from either
   monospaced or proportionally spaced fonts (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013).
   Note again that these null-findings in the work of Rello and
   Baeza-Yates (2013) are based on reading performance of older readers;
   typographical characteristics may have different effects in children
   who start to learn to read. Gianotten (2014b) suggested that dyslectics
   could benefit from larger fonts and more horizontal space and that
   larger interline space could lead to better reading performance. This
   assumption was recently challenged in a paper by van den Boer and
   Hakvoort (2015). They asked Dutch beginning (Grade 2) and more advanced
   readers (Grade 4), including a subsample of poor readers, to read a
   list of 144 words with varying interletter spacing. The results showed
   that none of the groups benefitted from extra, that is, above default
   interletter spacing of a 14-point Times New Roman font. Reduced
   interletter spacing (below the default value), however, affected
   reading fluency negatively in all groups.

   Although the relationship between reading problems and font
   characteristics is not yet clear, recent developments provide an
   opportunity to study the role of typographical characteristics in more
   depth. A number of different fonts have been created specifically for
   readers with dyslexia, such as “OpenDyslexic” (Gonzalez, 2015),
   “ReadRegularTM” (French, 2003), “Sylexiad” (Hillier, 2008), and the
   “Dyslexie font” © of Boer (2015). The designers of these fonts
   emphasize two main aspects, namely, differences between letters and
   weighted bottoms. The focus in the experiments testing the effect of
   font concerned reading performance and font preference. Rello and
   Baeza-Yates (2013) compared reading performance of participants with
   dyslexia while using two fonts that were created for people with
   dyslexia (i.e., OpenDyslexic and OpenDyslexic Italic) and ten other
   fonts that were not specifically designed for people with dyslexia.
   Reading text in OpenDyslexic or in OpenDyslexic Italic did not lead to
   a decrease in reading time compared to the other ten fonts. Moreover,
   participants did not show a preference for the font OpenDyslexic. They
   preferred Verdana and Helvetica to OpenDyslexic (Rello & Baeza-Yates,
   2013). Zikl et al. (2015) did not find significant differences either
   in reading speed and accuracy when the font OpenDyslexic was compared
   to Arial. Wery and Diliberto (2016) found similar results for reading
   rate and accuracy when they compared this font to Arial and Times New
   Roman.

   The font that is the object of this study concerns Christian Boer’s
   Dyslexie font launched in 2009. Boer (2015) claims that Dyslexie-letter
   shapes are more distinguishable than other fonts as a result of adding
   extra weight to the bottom of the letters using more oblique letters,
   enlarged openings within letters, different shapes, enlarged ascenders
   and descenders, punctuation and capitals in bold, different heights for
   almost similar letters, increased x-height, and more space between the
   letters.

   Although, this Dutch graphic designer claims that his font has positive
   effects on reading performance of dyslectics, there are no empirical
   studies that substantiate this. Boer (2011) supports his conjecture by
   referring to a study conducted by de Leeuw (2010), a master student
   from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. In her study, she had
   university students with (n = 21) and without dyslexia (n = 22) perform
   two reading tasks (i.e., word reading and pseudoword reading). They
   were asked to read both tests in Arial font as well as in Dyslexie
   font. Her conclusion was that no differences in reading speed between
   the task presented in Dyslexie font and Arial font emerged for either
   the students with or students without dyslexia. She also concluded that
   dyslectic students read more accurately in the Dyslexie font.
   Unfortunately, this could not be verified, because no proper
   statistical proof was presented. She also concluded that children with
   dyslexia had a more positive attitude towards the font Dyslexie. This
   conclusion could not be verified either, because again no statistical
   test was done to underpin this statement.

   In 2013, another master study was conducted at the University of Twente
   concerning the effect of the Dyslexie font on reading performance. This
   study by Pijpker (2013) targeted reading skill of children with
   (n = 22) and without (n = 42) dyslexia aged between 8 and 12 years
   attending a regular primary school. Each child read four different
   texts, that each had two levels of difficulty. Again, reading in
   Dyslexie font did not lead to a decrease in reading time or reading
   errors compared to reading in Arial in either the readers with or
   without dyslexia. When they divided the dyslectic readers in a group
   that read relatively well (n = 9) and one that read relatively poorly
   (n = 13), they found an effect of font in the poor dyslectic readers
   group, that is, they made fewer errors when reading the Dyslexie font
   than when reading in Arial.

   Recently, Marinus et al. (2016) compared Arial with Dyslexie in 39
   English-reading low-performing readers at text level. In a condition
   where they had not controlled for spacing, the Dyslexie font seemed to
   have a slight advantage over Arial (7% more words were read per
   minute), but after the fonts were matched for within-word and
   between-word spacing the effect disappeared. The authors therefore
   concluded that if the font Dyslexie aids reading, it is not because of
   its shape but rather because of the increase in word spacing. Thus, the
   claim by the designer Boer that letter shapes are responsible for the
   assumed increased legibility is doubtful (Marinus et al., 2016).
   Criticism on Boer’s claim also comes from the profession of typography.
   Gianotten (2014a, 2015), for example, questioned a couple of Boer’s
   typographical adaptations. One, the statement that the x-height of the
   Dyslexie font is larger than the x-height of other fonts is not
   correct. The x-height is a percentage of the capital height and body
   size (relative x-height). As shown in Table 1, the x-height of the
   Dyslexie font is 63% of the capital height and smaller than those of
   Arial and Times New Roman, and the x-height related to body size of the
   Dyslexie font is smaller than the relative x-height of the other two
   fonts.

   Two, Bessemans (2012) and Gianotten (2014a, 2015) state that the body
   size of the Dyslexie font is larger than Boer (2015) claims. Extra
   interline space is added by the designer resulting in an amount of
   interline space that is not in accordance with point size. As a result
   of this, the notation of corps size is incorrect.

   Three, according to Boer (2015), letters in the font Dyslexie are more
   distinct from each other than letters in other fonts and according to
   the designer this is its main effective characteristic. It has been
   suggested that specific subgroups, like children who are at the
   beginning of the reading process, people with visual disabilities, and
   children with dyslexia might benefit from fonts that are more
   distinctive (Pohlen, 2009; Unger, 2006). Williams (2001) argues that
   fonts that require more attention causes a text to be less readable,
   because the reader’s focus has to be shifted from the content of the
   text to the letter shapes. Wilkins et al. (2009) investigated this
   hypothesis and compared the reading performances in two fonts, namely
   Sassoon Primary and Verdana. Sassoon Primary letters are less
   distinctive than those of Verdana. Results showed that words written in
   Verdana font were read and searched more quickly by typical reading
   children than words written in Sassoon Primary font. Reading letters
   that are more distinctive might be beneficial to reading outcomes, this
   is in accordance with Boer’s statements. However, Marinus et al. (2016)
   have shown that, compared to the font Arial, the letters of the font
   Dyslexie are less distinct from one another.

   Reading is an important skill, and problems in reading can affect a
   person’s life in several ways. If a change in font eases the problems
   of people who have difficulty reading or learning to read, then it is
   the duty of scientists to share this knowledge. It is, however, also a
   scientist’s duty to test claims made by people to avoid
   disappointments, investments, and false hope. This study aims to
   contribute to sound scientific knowledge regarding the assumed effects
   of the font Dyslexie.

The present study

   The main goal, therefore, is to investigate whether the Dyslexie font
   is, as claimed by Boer, beneficial for readers with dyslexia. In two
   experiments, we will compare the effect of the Dyslexie font with the
   sans serif font Arial, recommended by the British Dyslexia Association
   (2014), and a wide-spread used standard serif font Times New Roman. To
   increase the possibility of finding differences between fonts,
   participants will be asked to read lists of unconnected words as well
   as texts. Because the focus of this study was the effect of font shape
   rather than interline spacing and font size, we controlled for these
   typographical aspects in the best way possible (more details in the
   Method sections).

   To avoid a confound with word or text characteristics, a full
   within-subjects design will be used. That is, participants will be
   asked to read the same texts or words written in different type faces.
   Experimental measures (see Method sections) will be taken to control
   for the so-called repetition effect, that is, the effect that a
   repeated reading of text or words is generally faster than a first
   reading (Lowder, Choi, & Gordon, 2013; Oliphant, 1983; Scarborough,
   Cortese, & Scarborough, 1977).

   Given earlier empirical findings, we do not expect the Dyslexie font to
   be more helpful in easing reading than Arial and Times New Roman. It
   may, however, be the case that readers who prefer the Dyslexie font
   read more effectively in that font. We therefore asked all participants
   to indicate their preference for a particular font and subsequently
   related this preference to reading performance.

   In sum, the main three questions of the present study are: (1) Does the
   Dyslexie font lead to faster and/or more accurate reading? (2) Do
   participants have a preference for the Dyslexie font? (3) Does a
   preference for a font affect reading performances? The group of
   participants in Experiment 1 consisted solely of children with
   dyslexia, whereas in Experiment 2 both children with and without
   dyslexia took part.

Experiment 1

Method

Participants

   All participants were recruited from an assessment and treatment
   program at Braams & Partners, an institution for learning disorders in
   the Netherlands. They were diagnosed with dyslexia in this clinical
   center, according to the requirements of the Protocol for Dyslexia
   (Blomert, 2006). Children whose standardized test scores on
   word-reading tests were below the tenth percentile or participants with
   standardized test scores on word reading below the 16th percentile and
   whose standardized test scores on word-spelling tests were below the
   10th percentile. Informed consent was obtained from all participants
   and their parents. A total of 170 Dutch children with dyslexia (100
   boys and 70 girls) were included in this study. Ages ranged from
   7;4 years to 12;4 years (M = 119.8 months, SD = 13.7). Participants
   were randomly assigned to two groups, which determined the sequence in
   which the examined fonts were presented. The age of participants in
   Order‘Arial - Dyslexie’ (M = 120.3 months, SD = 14.4) did not differ
   from that of participants in Order‘Dyslexie - Arial’ (M = 119.3 months,
   SD = 13.0), t(168) = .51, p = .61. Moreover, the average text-reading
   skills of the participants in the two groups were the same,
   t(168) = .32, p = .75. The text-reading skills, measured with the AVI
   reading cards (Krom, Jongen, Verhelst, Kamphuis, & Kleintjes, 2010)
   were comparable to those of an average pupil after 22 to 23 months of
   reading education (a little over 2 years).

Materials

   Reading speed and accuracy at text level were measured using the test
   card AVI 3A (Visser, van Laarhoven, & ter Beek, 1994). This test card
   is part of the AVI test package [AVI toets pakket] that contains nine
   test cards of increasing order of difficulty. Scores were based on the
   time participants needed to read the text and the total number of
   errors they made. Reliability is evaluated as “acceptable” (Egberink,
   Janssen, & Vermeulen, 2014a). The test card AVI 3A contains short
   sentences with words of one to four syllables (Visser et al., 1994).
   Two versions of test card 3A were used: one printed in font Arial and
   one printed in font Dyslexie. To correct for extra interline spacing
   and larger letters in the font Dyslexie, adjustments were made to the
   interline spacing and body size. Therefore, we used Arial in body size
   13 (capital height 3.28 mm, x-height 2.38 mm) with 1.35 vertical line
   spacing and the font Dyslexie in body size 12 (capital height 3.95 mm,
   x-height 2.51 mm) with 1.0 vertical line spacing.

Procedure

   Both tests were administered in separate sessions. Half of the children
   were asked to read the card in font Arial first (Time 1) and then in
   font Dyslexie (Time 2), whereas the other half of the participants read
   the cards in the reversed order. The time interval between the two
   sessions was one to 2 weeks. Following the final reading at Time 2, the
   participants were shown both texts and asked whether they had a
   preference for one of the two fonts. To reduce bias, participants were
   not informed about the names of the fonts.

   Results and Conclusion.

Reading performance

   Two separate 2 (Order: Arial – Dyslexie versus Dyslexie – Arial) × 2
   (Time: 1 versus 2) GLM repeated measures ANOVA’s with age as covariate
   was run on the scores of reading speed and reading accuracy,
   respectively. Time was a within-subjects factor and Order a
   between-subjects factor. The mean scores and standard deviations for
   reading speed and reading accuracy of the two Orders are presented in
   Table 2. As expected, the main effect of Time (i.e., repetition) on
   reading speed was highly significant, F(1, 167) = 33.86, p < .0001, η
   ^2 = 17. Participants read the text at Time 2 considerably faster than
   at Time 1; the number of errors did not decrease significantly after
   repeated reading F(1, 167) = 1.08, p < .30, η ^2 = .006. The effect of
   the covariate was also significant revealing that older students were
   faster readers F(1, 167) = 92.36, p < .0001, η ^2 = .36, and made fewer
   errors, F(1, 167) = 34.55, p < .0001, η ^2 = .17.

   *The Order Arial – Dyslexie refers to the fact that at Time 1 the
   participants read the text in font Arial and at Time 2, they read the
   text in font Dyslexie. For the Order Dyslexie – Arial the order was
   reversed.

   The main effect of Order was not significant with respect to speed or
   accuracy, F < 1, and F(1,167) = 2.78, p = .10, η ^2 = .02,
   respectively. Thus, the order in which the fonts were read did not
   affect reading speed and reading accuracy differentially. The
   interaction effect of Time and Order was also significant with respect
   to reading speed, F(1, 167) = 7.50, p < .007, η ^2 = .04, but not with
   respect to accuracy, F < 1. This interaction will be investigated in
   the following analysis.

   To investigate the question whether reading in the Dyslexie font aids
   reading separate GLM univariate analyses were conducted at Times 1 and
   2 in which Font was a between-subjects factor and age in months served
   as covariate. Reading speed between Arial and Dyslexie did not differ
   significantly at Times 1 and 2, both F’s < 1. The analysis regarding
   accuracy yielded similar non-significant results, Time 1: F(1,
   167) = 1.78, p = .18; Time 2: F(1, 167) = 3.04, p = .08.

Font preference

   In the group of children that read Arial first and Dyslexie second, a
   preference for Arial was shown by 44.7% of the participants, 37.6%
   preferred the font Dyslexie, and the remaining 17.6% did not have a
   preference. In the group of children that read Dyslexie first and Arial
   second, 61.9% had a preference for Arial, 20.2% had a preference for
   Dyslexie, and 17.9% had no preference. The distribution of preferences
   was significantly different for the two groups, χ^2 (2) = 6.76,
   p = .03). Therefore, the effect of preference on reading performance
   was tested separately for the two groups.

Reading performance and font preference

   To test for the effect of preference on reading speed and reading
   errors eight separate Univariate GLM’s were conducted on reading speed
   and reading errors with font preference as independent variable. Age
   served again as covariate. Means, standard deviations, and F tests are
   presented in Table 3. The effect of the covariate was significant in
   all eight analyses. These effects have been discussed in the previous
   analyses.

   *The experimenter forgot to ask one child about her preference;
   analysis was therefore based on 169 children rather than 170.

   Only one of the analyses reached significance, namely the one
   pertaining to Time 1, where students who read the font Dyslexie showed
   a significant main effect of preference. Subsequent Bonferroni
   corrected pairwise comparisons revealed no difference in reading speed
   of the text written in Dyslexie between those who preferred Dyslexie
   font and those who preferred Arial font, p = 1.0. Those without a
   preference, however, were slower in reading the text in Dyslexie than
   those who preferred Dyslexie, p < .02, but were not slower than the
   children who preferred Arial, p = .16.

Conclusion

   Children with dyslexia read text written in font Dyslexie as fast as in
   font Arial and they made a comparable number of errors. Participants
   generally preferred Arial above Dyslexie and preference for either of
   the fonts was not related to better reading. Moreover, the second
   reading of the same text was indeed faster than the first time the text
   was read; the order in which the texts were read did not affect reading
   speed or reading accuracy.

Experiment 2

   In Experiments 2, the claim was tested that the font Dyslexie would
   benefit reading at the word level. The serif font Times New Roman was
   added, because of its widespread use in books. The same questions that
   were investigated in Experiment 1 were subject of investigation in
   Experiment 2. For reason explained below, the repetition effect in this
   experiment is probably limited or even absent.

Method

Participants

   The participant group in Experiment 2 consisted of children with
   dyslexia (n = 102) and without dyslexia (n = 45) who were all attending
   regular primary education. Like in Experiment 1, the participants with
   dyslexia were recruited from Braams & Partners, an institution for
   learning disorders. The selection criteria were equal to those in
   Experiment 1. Participants with dyslexia were recruited from Grades 2
   to 6. Ages ranged from 7;9 years to 12;10 years (M = 123.9 months,
   SD = 14.1). Participants without dyslexia were recruited from Grades 2
   to 4. Ages ranged from 7;6 years to 11;9 years (M = 110.2 months,
   SD = 12.9).

   Informed consent was obtained from all participants and their parents.
   Participants were randomly assigned to one of three Font-order
   conditions (see Procedure). There were no significant differences
   between the age of the participants in the three Font-order conditions,
   F < 1. Moreover, the average text-reading skills of the participants in
   the three Font-order conditions were the same, F < 1. The text-reading
   skills, measured with the AVI reading cards (Krom et al., 2010) were
   comparable to those of an average pupil after 30 to 31 months of
   reading education.

Materials

   To determine the word reading skills of the participants, the Three
   Minute Test [Drie Minuten Toets, DMT] (Krom et al., 2010) was used.
   This is a time-limited test consisting of three cards with words of
   different levels. The first card (i.e., Card 1) contains CV, VC, CVC
   words. The second card (i.e., Card 2) contains CCV, CCVC, CVCC, CCVCC,
   CCCVC, and CVCCC words. The third card (i.e., Card 3) contains
   multisyllabic words. The participants were asked to read aloud the
   words as fast and as accurately as possible. The number of words read
   correctly within 1 min determines the score. Reliability and validity
   are considered to be good (Egberink, Janssen, & Vermeulen, 2014b).
   There are three comparable versions available (i.e., versions A, B, and
   C). Each version contains the same words, but the words are presented
   in a different order. The fact that the versions are not identical may
   reduce or even nullify the repetition effect.

   Although the versions are assumed to be comparable, all versions were
   converted in the three different fonts, to prevent inferences by the
   version of the test. In order to correct for the extra
   interline-spacing and larger letters in the font Dyslexie, adjustments
   were made to the interline spacing and body size. We tried to match for
   x-height. Therefore, for Cards 1 and 2, we used Arial point size 16
   (capital height 4.04 mm, x-height 2.93 mm), Times New Roman in point
   size 16 (capital height 3.75 mm, x-height 2.53 mm), both with interline
   space 1.15, and Dyslexie in point size 13 (capital height 4.28 mm,
   x-height 2.72 mm) with interline space 0.85. For Card 3, we used Arial
   point size 14 (capital height 3.54 mm, x-height 2.57 mm), Times New
   Roman in point size 14 (capital height 3.28 mm, x-height 2.21 mm), both
   with vertical line spacing 1.30 and Dyslexie in point size 11 (capital
   height 3.62 mm, x-height 2.30 mm) with 1.0 vertical line spacing.

Procedure

   Participants were tested at three different measurements (i.e., Times
   1, 2, and 3) and read the cards in all three fonts. The time interval
   between sessions was one to 2 weeks. In Table 4 the design used in
   Experiment 2 is displayed. At Time 1, version A of the cards was
   applied, at Time 2 version B, and at Time 3 version C. After card
   reading at Time 3, participants were also asked whether they had a
   preference for one of the three fonts.

   Apart from the significant effect of the covariate, F(1, 140) = 113.4,
   p < .0001, η ^2 = .45, there was a significant main effect of Group, F
   (1, 140) = 44.2, p < .0001, η ^2 = .24. Children without dyslexia had
   faster reading times than children with dyslexia on all three cards.
   The main effect of Card was also significant, F(2, 280) = 27.5,
   p < .0001, η ^2 = .16. Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparisons
   revealed that scores on Cards 1 were significantly higher than on Cards
   2, which in turn were significantly higher than on Cards 3 (all
   p’s < .0001), which confirms the fact that orthographically complex
   words are more difficult to read than orthographically simple words
   (Card 1 is the easiest and 3 the most difficult). Neither the main
   effect of Font order nor the interaction between Font order and any of
   the other variables reached significant levels, indicating no
   differences with respect to ease of reading between the different
   fonts. To substantiate our finding, we present all Univariate GLM’s
   with age as covariate for each Card at each moment of time. Findings in
   Table 5 clearly show that fonts were equally easy (or difficult for
   that matter) to read.

Font preference

   A preference for Arial was shown by 38.1% of the participants, 29.9%
   preferred Times New Roman, and 11.6% chose the font Dyslexie. The
   remaining 19.7% did not have a preference. A one-sample chi-squared
   test showed that fewer participants showed a preference for the font
   Dyslexie than expected, fewer participants showed no preference than
   expected, but more participants preferred Arial than expected and more
   participants preferred Times New Roman than expected (χ^2 (3) = 23.92,
   p < .0001). The distribution of the preferences, however, was
   significantly different for children with and children without dyslexia
   (χ^2 (3) = 10.54, p < .015). Of the children with dyslexia, 45.1%
   preferred Arial, 29.4% Times New Roman, and 10.8% Dyslexie. The
   remaining 13.7% had no preference. Of the children without dyslexia,
   22.2% preferred Arial, 31.1% Times New Roman, and 13.3% Dyslexie. The
   remaining 33.3% had no preference.

Reading performance and font preference

   To test for the effect of preference on reading performance, a 2
   (Group: children with dyslexia vs. children without dyslexia) by 4
   (Preference: Dyslexie vs. Arial vs. Times New Roman vs. None) × 3
   (Font: Dyslexie vs. Arial vs. Times New Roman) GLM repeated measures
   ANOVA was conducted on the total number of words read correctly on the
   sum score of all three Cards. Font served as within-subjects variable,
   preference as a between-subjects variable, and age served as covariate.
   Apart from the significant effects of the covariate, F(1,
   137) = 108.84, p < .0001, η ^2 = .44, and the significant effect of
   Group, F(1, 137) = 28.10, p < .0001, η ^2 = .17, none of the other
   effects reached significance: main effects of Font, F(2, 274 = 1.22,
   p = .30, η ^2 = .009, and Preference, F(3, 137) = 1.15, p = .33, η
   ^2 = .025. The non-significant interaction between Font and Preference,
   F(6, 274) = 1.10, p = .36, η ^2 = .023, indicated no relationship
   between preference and number of words read correctly. Mean scores are
   presented in Table 6.

   *The information on preference for one child with dyslexia was lost;
   analysis was therefore based on 146 children rather than 147

Conclusion

   Despite the fact that the children without dyslexia were more than
   1 year younger than children with dyslexia, they proved to be the
   better reader. This emphasizes the fact that the group of children who
   were diagnosed with dyslexia are indeed poor readers. Participants with
   and without dyslexia read as many words correctly during 1 min in the
   font Dyslexie as they did in Arial and Times New Roman. Neither of the
   groups showed a preference for the font Dyslexie; in fact more
   participants preferred Arial and Times New Roman above Dyslexie.
   Moreover, preference was not related to number of words read correctly.
   Finally, no effect of repeated reading occurred, which corroborates our
   assumption that the different order of words on the cards causes the
   cards to be similar but not identical.

General discussion

   This study was conducted to test whether the font Dyslexie could be
   beneficial for readers with dyslexia. Our first question concerned the
   effect of font on reading performances. Reading performance of children
   with and without dyslexia at word and text level are not better when
   they read in the font Dyslexie compared to the fonts Arial and Times
   New Roman. Although no effect on reading performance was found, it was
   possible that children with dyslexia displayed a preference for the
   font developed for children with dyslexia. Therefore, our second
   research question examined the preferences of children with and without
   dyslexia for a particular font. At text level, children with dyslexia
   preferred the font Arial over Dyslexie. The font Dyslexie was favored
   the least by children with and without dyslexia at the word level. The
   third research question was whether reading texts or words in the
   preferred font, would lead to better reading outcomes. We found no
   effect of reading a text or words in the preferred font on reading
   performances for dyslexic children or for children without dyslexia.

   The results of both our experiments do not support the claim that the
   font Dyslexie facilitates the reading of dyslexic people. These
   findings are mostly in line with other Dutch studies conducted by de
   Leeuw (2010) and Pijpker (2013). First, de Leeuw (2010) found no
   effects of font on reading speed. However, these conclusions concerning
   reading speed were based on the effects of raw scores, that is, the
   number of words read correctly in 1 min. Normally the raw score is the
   number of words read in 1 min, irrespective of whether the words are
   read correctly or not. The “raw scores” in this study not only
   represent the reading speed, but also the accuracy of reading. Thus, in
   line with our results, de Leeuw found no effect of font on the number
   of words read correctly. Second, her conclusion that dyslectic students
   made fewer errors in the Dyslexie font version of the word-reading task
   (M = 1.3, SD = 1.4) than in the Arial font version (M = 1.7, SD = 1.3)
   could not be verified, because no proper statistical proof was
   presented. Finally, for pseudoword reading no effects were found
   either. Also in line with our findings are the results of Pijpker
   (2013), who found no effect at text level. The only effect in her study
   emerged when the group of dyslectic readers were divided into
   relatively good and poor readers. Note, that she did not make clear how
   this distinction was made. Thus, empirical evidence for Boer’s claim
   that the font Dyslexie has positive effects on the reading performances
   of people with dyslexia is lacking. His claim was based on just this
   one effect.

   At this point, we need to discuss the fact that a major part of our
   standpoint is based on an abundance of null-findings, statistically a
   not very convincing argument. Note, however, that the experiments
   revealed three significant findings in line with previous research.
   First, in both experiments, a highly significant effect of age (the
   covariate) emerged; older children performed consistently better than
   younger children (e.g., Verhoeven & van Leeuwe, 2003). Second,
   Experiment 1 revealed a robust repetition effect as a result of
   repeated reading of identical materials, which converges with results
   from numerous studies on word and text reading (see for a
   meta-analysis, Thierren, 2004). Third, Experiment 2 revealed that
   reading single, isolated words in children with dyslexia was
   significantly worse than that of children without dyslexia. With
   respect to all null-findings related to the effect of font on reading
   performance, we would like to put forward that the majority of the
   statistical analyses revealed F-values smaller than 1, values that are
   not even approaching significance.

   Both experiments showed that the font Dyslexie was not preferred by the
   children with dyslexia or by the children with normal reading
   development. These findings are in contradiction with the findings by
   de Leeuw (2010). She claimed that participants with dyslexia have a
   more positive attitude towards the font Dyslexie than typical reading
   students, based on the percentages of the answers given by the students
   with dyslexia and without dyslexia (i.e., on the four categories
   “unpleasant”, “neutral”, “pleasant”, and “very pleasant”) and reported
   no statistical analyses to underpin this conclusion. Furthermore, these
   differences in findings between the results of de Leeuw (2010) and the
   present study could be explained by a difference in procedure that has
   been followed. In de Leeuw’s research, participants were asked whether
   they preferred the font that was especially designed for people with
   dyslexia. In our research, the participants were not informed about the
   names of the fonts. The more positive attitude towards the font
   Dyslexie in de Leeuw’s research might be affected by her procedure. For
   people with dyslexia, the message that a simple solution like the use
   of a special font might lead to better reading outcomes can be rather
   hopeful. On top of that, de Leeuw (2010) presented only a selection of
   the results of the questionnaire measuring font preference in her
   thesis. In the appendix of her master thesis she reported all five
   questions asking the students how they experienced the font Dyslexie
   but again, no statistical analyses were given. When the students with
   dyslexia and the students with a normal reading development were asked
   whether they would use the font Dyslexie, no groups’ differences could
   be revealed (de Leeuw, 2010).

   All in all, the font Dyslexie, developed to facilitate the reading of
   dyslexic people, does not have the desired effect. Children with
   dyslexia do not read better when text is printed in the font Dyslexie
   than when text is printed in Arial or Times New Roman. One of the
   claims of the designer of the font Dyslexie (Boer, 2015), was that it
   facilitates reading because of the difference between the letters.
   According to Boer (2015), letters in the font Dyslexie are more
   distinct from each other than letters in other fonts. Marinus et al.
   (2016), however, have shown that, compared to the font Arial, the
   letters of the font Dyslexie are less distinct from one another. The
   statement that the relative x-height of the font Dyslexie is larger
   compared to other fonts, is not correct either (Gianotten, 2014a,
   2015). This might explain the finding that dyslexic children did not
   read faster or more accurate when reading in the font Dyslexie than in
   Arial.

   Contrary to our findings, Marinus et al. (2016) did find that children
   with reading problems read English texts significantly faster in font
   Dyslexie than in Arial. However, they concluded that these results
   could not explained by the shape of the letters, but the broader
   spacing settings. In our experiments, we controlled for vertical
   spacing, but not for horizontal spacing. It would have been interesting
   if we had added this variable to examine the effects of spacing in
   words and texts on the reading performances on young children with
   dyslexia. Furthermore, we tried to control for the adaptations Boer
   made to the body size of the font by comparing the font Dyslexie with a
   smaller point size than the fonts Arial and Times New Roman; note that,
   these measurements do not exactly match. We do not believe that this
   has affected the results, because differences in x-height only emerge
   when the differences in x-heights are substantial (Bernard et al.,
   2002). As explained in the introduction, it is not possible to control
   for all variables at the same time.

   In sum, the adaptations made to create the font Dyslexie have been
   disputed and the empirical findings also challenge the claim that
   Dyslexie is a better font for dyslectics. We haste to add that Dyslexie
   does not affect reading negatively. If children prefer to read texts in
   Dyslexie, there is no reason to discourage this. However, Wery and
   Diliberto (2016) warn for other negative effects using a font that
   claims to make reading easier. Readers who already have experienced
   major disappointments in learning to read may find it distressing when
   they fail to encounter positive effects of font characteristics. Also,
   purchasing the Dyslexie font and transferring materials into this font
   could also shift the focus (time and money) from interventions that
   have been proven effective (Wery & Diliberto, 2016). Therefore, we
   advise to focus on effective interventions for better reading outcomes.
   An effective intervention to improve reading in both accuracy and
   fluency contains (1) an expanded instruction in reading and (2) an
   increase of the number of words and text read (Bosman & Gijsel, 2007).
   To encourage reading, we believe that children should take advantage of
   the free available technical opportunities to adjust font type, font
   size and spacing options in digital texts to their personal preference.
   The purchase of a special font for dyslectics will then probably be
   unnecessary. Future research should focus on adjustments to texts that
   could be done easily by changing the settings in computers, laptops,
   tablets and e-readers to facilitate reading. A collaboration between
   the field of researchers in typography and psychology is recommended.

Abstract

   We have obtained the first data demonstrating the capability of
   multicellular organisms for longterm cryobiosis in permafrost deposits
   of the Arctic. The viable soil nematodes Panagrolaimus aff.
   detritophagus (Rhabditida) and Plectus aff. parvus (Plectida) were
   isolated from the samples of Pleistocene permafrost deposits of the
   Kolyma River Lowland. The duration of natural cryopreservation of the
   nematodes corresponds to the age of the deposits, 30 000–40 000 years.

Abstract

   This paper presents a global scale assessment of the impact of climate
   change on water scarcity. Patterns of climate change from 21 Global
   Climate Models (GCMs) under four SRES scenarios are applied to a global
   hydrological model to estimate water resources across 1339 watersheds.
   The Water Crowding Index (WCI) and the Water Stress Index (WSI) are
   used to calculate exposure to increases and decreases in global water
   scarcity due to climate change. 1.6 (WCI) and 2.4 (WSI) billion people
   are estimated to be currently living within watersheds exposed to water
   scarcity. Using the WCI, by 2050 under the A1B scenario, 0.5 to 3.1
   billion people are exposed to an increase in water scarcity due to
   climate change (range across 21 GCMs). This represents a higher
   upper-estimate than previous assessments because scenarios are
   constructed from a wider range of GCMs. A substantial proportion of the
   uncertainty in the global-scale effect of climate change on water
   scarcity is due to uncertainty in the estimates for South Asia and East
   Asia. Sensitivity to the WCI and WSI thresholds that define water
   scarcity can be comparable to the sensitivity to climate change
   pattern. More of the world will see an increase in exposure to water
   scarcity than a decrease due to climate change but this is not
   consistent across all climate change patterns. Additionally,
   investigation of the effects of a set of prescribed global mean
   temperature change scenarios show rapid increases in water scarcity due
   to climate change across many regions of the globe, up to 2 °C,
   followed by stabilisation to 4 °C.

1 Introduction

   Water scarcity is a major global issue. Existing pressures on water
   resources will be exacerbated by increases in population and also by
   climate change. Various studies have explored how both these factors
   might affect global water scarcity in the future by using population
   projections and simulated changes in climate from global climate models
   (GCMs) with water resources models (Alcamo et al. 2007; Arnell 2004;
   Arnell et al. 2011; Gosling et al. 2010; Hayashi et al. 2010; Oki and
   Kanae 2006).

   Most of this work acknowledges that projections of water scarcity are
   dependent upon not only scenarios of population change and emissions,
   but also the number of GCMs used for simulating the future climate.
   There are over 20 GCMs included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset (Meehl et al. 2007a), which
   all simulate different but plausible climates under identical emissions
   scenarios (Meehl et al. 2007b). Previous global assessments of the
   impact of climate change on water scarcity have used various numbers of
   CMIP3 GCMs ranging from one to six (Arnell 2004; Hayashi et al. 2010).
   Additional uncertainty can arise from the measure used to define water
   scarcity (Alcamo et al. 2007).

   This paper presents the most comprehensive global-scale assessment to
   date of the impact of climate change on water scarcity.
   “Comprehensiveness” is interpreted as taking account of the various
   factors that affect climate change impacts assessment, including; the
   range of possible future climates projected by different GCMs, the
   different magnitudes of possible climate change due to different
   emissions trajectories, different population projections and water
   withdrawals, and differing methods for estimating water scarcity. To
   achieve this, we use climate change patterns from 21 CMIP3 GCMs, four
   socio-economic and emissions scenarios, and two different measures of
   water scarcity. We only use a single hydrological model, however, so we
   do not sample hydrological modelling uncertainty.

   The overarching aim of the paper is to assess how our more
   comprehensive estimates of global water scarcity compare to previous
   assessments. Additionally, in light of The Copenhagen Accord and Durban
   Platform, which state ambitions of limiting the increase in global mean
   temperature to 2 °C and 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial value
   respectively, we assess how different amounts of global mean warming up
   to 4 °C might affect global water scarcity.

2 Methodology

2.1 Introduction

   The experimental design involved applying the patterns of climate
   change from 21 GCMs to a global hydrological model to calculate average
   annual runoff, which in turn was used to estimate global water scarcity
   with a water resources model.

2.2 Climate change scenarios

   Two types of scenarios are considered for each of the 21 GCMs; 1) four
   SRES emissions scenarios (B1, B2, A1B and A2) for three 30-year time
   horizons centred on 2020, 2050 and 2080; and 2) seven prescribed
   changes in global mean temperature relative to present (0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
   2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 4.0 °C of 30-year duration each). The current climate
   is characterised by the CRU TS3.1 data set (Harris et al. 2012) for the
   1961–1990 time horizon, which is approximately 0.3 °C above
   pre-industrial.

   Spatial and temporal climate change scenarios at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution
   were constructed by pattern-scaling output from 21 CMIP3 GCMs (Meehl et
   al. 2007a) with ClimGen (Todd et al. 2011). ClimGen uses the change
   pattern for any given GCM to perturb a historical dataset (CRU TS3.1 in
   this study) to ensure minimal bias with respect to observations. This
   is often referred to as the delta method (Arnell and Gosling 2013).
   Further details on pattern-scaling and the 21 GCMs we used are in
   Online Resource 1 in the Electronic Supplementary Materials (ESM) file.
   Not all 21 GCMs are independent of each other and they are considered
   equally plausible in this analysis. To help explore the effects of
   using different GCMs, we selected HadCM3 as an illustrative ‘marker’
   GCM, which presents a plausible characterisation of the spatial
   variability of change in climate (Arnell et al. 2013).

2.3 The global hydrological model and water resources model

   Simulations of average annual runoff across the global domain at a
   spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°, for every climate change pattern and
   scenario, were performed with an established global hydrological model,
   Mac-PDM.09 (Gosling and Arnell 2011). Mac-PDM.09 is used in several
   recent studies (Arnell and Gosling 2013; Arnell et al. 2013; Hagemann
   et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2013). Further details about Mac-PDM.09
   are included in Online Resource 2.

   The runoff simulations from Mac-PDM.09 were applied to a water
   resources model (Arnell et al. 2011; Gosling et al. 2010) to estimate
   water scarcity. For every climate change pattern we calculated two
   well-known measures of water scarcity (Rockström et al. 2009; Oki and
   Kanae 2006); 1) “Water Crowding Index” (WCI; a measure of the annual
   water resources per capita in a watershed) and 2) “The Water Stress
   Index” (WSI; a measure of the ratio of water withdrawals to resources).
   A WCI threshold of <1,000 m^3/capita/year and a WSI of >0.4 were used
   to indicate exposure to water scarcity (Rockström et al. 2009). For
   both measures, available water resource in each of 1339 watersheds
   across the globe was calculated by summing simulated average annual
   runoff from each 0.5° × 0.5° grid cell within a given watershed. WCI is
   heavily dependent upon population size while the WSI accounts for
   variations in withdrawals across watersheds and therefore tends to
   highlight pressures in watersheds with large amounts of irrigation.
   The water resources model calculates four metrics (Arnell et al. 2011)
   that isolate the sole impact of future climate change on water scarcity
   (i.e. they represent the additional impact of climate change on top of
   population and/or withdrawals pressure). This involves calculating
   first, future water scarcity in the absence of climate change (i.e. due
   to future population and/or withdrawals pressure only) and then
   subtracting this from the water scarcity that occurs due to the
   combined effects of future climate change and population and/or
   withdrawals pressure. The four metrics are:
    1. 1)
       The number of people in a region who live in watersheds with no
       water scarcity in the absence of climate change but that enter
       water scarcity due to climate change.

    2. 2)
       The number of people in a region who live in watersheds with water
       scarcity in the absence of climate change but that move out of
       water scarcity due to climate change.

    3. 3)
       The number of people in a region living in watersheds with water
       scarcity in the absence of climate change who see a “significant”
       decrease in runoff due to climate change.

    4. 4)
       The number of people in a region living in watersheds with water
       scarcity in the absence of climate change who see a “significant”
       increase in runoff due to climate change but who still remain in
       water scarcity.

   A “significant” change in runoff is defined to be greater than the
   standard deviation of average annual runoff due to natural
   multi-decadal climatic variability. This was calculated from multiple
   estimates of the 30-year average annual runoff using climate scenarios
   constructed from a long unforced simulation with the HadCM3 climate
   change pattern (Arnell and Gosling 2013).

   For each of the two water scarcity measures, the impact of climate
   change on exposure to water scarcity (i.e. on top of future population
   and/or withdrawals pressure) is summarised by summing 1) and 3) to
   characterise population exposed to a potential increase in water
   scarcity due to climate change, and summing 2) and 4) to characterise
   population with a potential reduction in water scarcity due to climate
   change. Throughout the manuscript, for conciseness, these are referred
   to as an “increase in scarcity” and a “decrease in scarcity”,
   respectively, and the estimates for each can be considered as relative
   to the situation in the future (e.g. 2050) where there is higher
   population and withdrawals than present.

2.4 Socio-economic scenarios

   When exploring water scarcity due to climate change under SRES
   scenarios, future population was taken from the IMAGE v2.3
   representation of the B1, B2, A1B and A2 storylines (Van Vuuren et al.
   2007) and used with the appropriate runoff simulations in the water
   scarcity model. When exploring the prescribed warming scenarios, future
   population was assumed to be equivalent to that under SRES A1B for the
   30-year time horizon centred on 2050, because these climate projections
   are not associated with any specific time in the future or SRES
   scenario. Withdrawals were estimated by rescaling Shen et al.’s (2008)
   projections to match the population projections used here. Note that
   different projections of future withdrawals would give different
   indications of future water resources scarcity.

   Watershed population exposure to water scarcity was aggregated to the
   national scale and then to the regional scale, so water scarcity can be
   expressed regionally in absolute (millions of people) and relative (as
   a percentage of regional population) terms. The countries included in
   each region are listed in Online Resource 3 and displayed in a map in
   Online Resource 4.

3 Results

3.1 Water scarcity in the absence of climate change

   In the year 2000, depending on the measure of water scarcity, 1.6 (25 %
   of global population) and 2.4 billion (39 %) people are estimated to be
   living in watersheds exposed to water scarcity (Table 1). The greatest
   proportions of populations living in water-scarce watersheds are
   located in East Asia (660 and 666 million) and South Asia (491 and
   1004). More people fall into the water scarcity category with the WSI
   than with the WCI (Table 1; see also Online Resource 5 for global
   maps). Notable regions where the two water scarcity measures result in
   opposing results (i.e. one measure results in water scarcity and the
   other measure does not), include parts of the US and Australasia.

   Please refer to Online Resource 3 and Online Resource 4 for details of
   the regional classification

   Total global population in the years 2000, 2020, 2050 and 2080, under
   the A1B scenario, is estimated to be 6.1, 7.3, 8.2 and 7.8 billion
   respectively. This places pressures on future water resources and in
   the absence of climate change it is estimated that by 2050 under A1B,
   3.1 (37 %) and 4.3 billion (53 %) people will be living in watersheds
   exposed to water scarcity, globally. The greatest absolute exposure to
   water scarcity is in South Asia (1.5 and 1.7 billion) and East Asia
   (0.7 and 1.2 billion).

3.2 Runoff changes

   Simulated changes in average annual runoff by 2050 from Mac-PDM.09,
   when it is forced with the pattern of climate change from the HadCM3
   GCM only under A1B, show runoff increases relative to present
   (1961–1990) across large areas of East Asia (+30 %), South Asia
   (+30 %), the high northern latitudes (+40 %), and East Africa (+20 %)
   (see Online Resource 6(a)). Some areas see up to +90 % increases in
   runoff. Changes in runoff in South Asia and East Asia reflect large
   changes in climate on a large regional runoff volume seen in the
   present climate. Declines in runoff are simulated for Brasil (−60 %),
   South America (−30 %), Southern Africa (−40 %), Western Europe (−20 %)
   and Central Europe (−30 %).

   In line with previous assessments (Gosling et al. 2010; Milly et al.
   2005), there is high consistency that runoff decreases with climate
   change across central Europe and that it increases in the high northern
   latitudes but there is less agreement between all CMIP3 model climate
   change patterns across many regions of the globe, including parts of
   South Asia and East Asia (see Online Resource 6(b)). There is little
   change in the pattern of consistency when different time horizons (2020
   and 2080) or scenarios (B1, B2, A2) are considered (not displayed).

3.3 Water scarcity due to climate change only under SRES scenarios

   Regions of the globe experience both increases and decreases in water
   scarcity in the future due to the sole effects of climate change (see
   Fig. 1; expressed as a percentage of future regional population, and
   Online Resource 7; expressed in millions of people). We present the
   estimates associated with each climate change pattern and the range
   across the ensemble but we do not calculate any measures of central
   tendency because these can be an unreliable summary indicator of
   climate change impacts (Gosling et al. 2012). Tables that present the
   absolute and relative values displayed in Fig. 1 are presented in
   Online Resources 8–11). In Fig. 1, an increase in water scarcity of
   100 % for a region would mean that in 2050, 100 % of the people living
   in watersheds in that region experience an increase in water scarcity
   that is attributable solely to climate change (i.e. the increase is not
   due to changes in population or withdrawals; it is additional to them).
   A number of general conclusions can be drawn from these results.

   different marker shape assigned to each SRES scenario. Filled red

   experience an increase in water scarcity due to climate change than a
   decrease, but this is not necessarily the case for individual models.
   In 2050 and under A1B, an increase in water scarcity is experienced
   globally by 0.5 to 3.1 billion (WCI) and 0.8 to 3.9 billion (WSI); a
   decrease is experienced by 0.2 to 2.2 and 0.1 to 2.7 billion for each
   water scarcity measure respectively. This is consistent across SRES
   scenarios as well as the two measures of water scarcity. However, this
   result does not hold for every individual CMIP3 model. For example,
   with the HadCM3 pattern more people are exposed to a decrease in
   scarcity (1.9 and 2.7 billion) than an increase (1.0 and 1.3) by 2050.

   In absolute terms, uncertainty in the effects of climate change on
   water scarcity due to the application of all CMIP3 models is greatest
   for South Asia and East Asia. Here, by 2050 and under the A1B scenario,
   between 52–1460 million and 0–506 million people are exposed to
   increased water scarcity respectively, when using the WCI. If these two
   estimates are expressed as a fraction of the total global population,
   then South Asia and East Asia account for 1–18 % and 0–6 % respectively
   of the global population exposed to increased water scarcity due to
   climate change. Thus a substantial proportion of the uncertainty in the
   global-scale effect of climate change on water scarcity is due to
   uncertainties in estimating the effects in South Asia and East Asia.
   Close investigation of Fig. 2 explains why this uncertainty range is so
   large for South Asia and East Asia and also why it is greater for the
   WSI than the WCI. While the application of a single GCM (HadCM3)
   indicates that some watersheds in East Asia move out of water scarcity
   and/or see a decrease due to climate change, when using all CMIP3
   models around 4–10/21 simulations indicate that water scarcity
   increases in these watersheds and around 11–14/21 show a decease in
   scarcity. Climate change affects more watersheds in East Asia when
   using the WSI than the WCI, which means the uncertainty across
   simulations showing increases and decreases in water scarcity translate
   into a larger uncertainty range in absolute terms.

   The effect of climate change only on exposure to water scarcity in 2050
   under the SRES A1B scenario, using the WCI (1,000 m^3/capita/year; left
   panels) and the WSI (0.4; right panels). Top panels display the change
   in scarcity classes with the HadCM3 GCM only. The other panels show
   consistency across 21 simulations (with all CMIP3 models), in terms of
   the number of simulations out of 21 that show an increase in exposure
   (indicative of where there is an increase in scarcity or a watershed
   moves into water scarcity; middle panels), or decreases (a decrease in
   scarcity or move out of scarcity; bottom panels)

   The differences in projections of water scarcity across the four
   scenarios are relatively small when compared with the differences
   across the 21 simulations. Globally, the absolute (relative) increases
   in scarcity by 2050 with HadCM3, when using the WCI are 1.0 (13 %), 1.0
   (12 %), 1.1 (12 %) and 1.4 billion (14 %), for A1B, B1, B2 and A2
   respectively. By comparison, the minimum and maximum values across the
   21 simulations for absolute (relative) increases in scarcity by 2050
   and using the same scarcity measure are 0.5 and 3.1 (6 and 38 %), 0.5
   and 2.8 (6 and 34 %), 0.6 and 3.5 (6 and 39 %), and 0.7 and 4.7 billion
   (7 and 46 %) for A1B, B1, B2 and A2 respectively. This means that the
   range across the 21 simulations with all CMIP3 models for a single
   scenario (e.g. A1B) is greater than the range across all four emissions
   scenarios for a single GCM (HadCM3). This is observed at both the
   global-scale and at the regional-scale.

3.4 Sensitivity to the WCI and WSI thresholds for water scarcity

   So far we have described exposure to water scarcity due to climate
   change based upon the two measures of water scarcity (WCI and WSI) with
   scarcity indicator thresholds of <1,000 m^3/capita/year and >0.4
   respectively. A more rigorous analysis of the sensitivity of water
   scarcity exposure to the scarcity measure compares scarcity indicator
   thresholds (500, 1,000, 1,700 m^3/capita/year and 0.1, 0.2, 0.4
   respectively) (see Fig. 3 for relative exposure and Online Resource 12
   for absolute exposure). These thresholds, which are arbitrary, have
   been used previously with the WCI for defining “extreme water shortage”
   (<500), “chronic water shortage” (<1000) and “moderate water shortage”
   (<1700) (Kummu et al. 2010; Arnell 2004) and with the WSI for defining
   “low stress” (>0.1), “medium stress” (>0.2) and “high stress” (>0.4)
   (Arnell 1999). This analysis demonstrates how sensitive estimates of
   water scarcity are to the selection of arbitrary thresholds.

   Comparison of WCI and WSI water scarcity measure thresholds. Exposure
   to an increase or decrease in water scarcity due to climate change is
   expressed as a percentage of regional future population in 2050,
   assuming the A1B scenario

   The sensitivity of exposure to the three thresholds for each measure is
   appreciable. Generally, it is greater than sensitivity of exposure to
   SRES scenario but slightly less than sensitivity to climate change
   pattern. For example, the estimated increase in global exposure to
   water scarcity by 2050 under A1B and using the WCI
   (1,000 m^3/capita/year) is 0.5 to 3.1 billion (6–38 %) across all CMIP3
   models, while it is 0.5 to 1.5 billion (6–18 %) across the three WCI
   thresholds with HadCM3. This compares with 1.0 to 1.4 billion (12–14 %)
   across the four SRES scenarios with HadCM3. For some regions the
   sensitivity to indicator is comparable to sensitivity to climate change
   pattern (Central Asia and Central Europe).

3.5 Water scarcity due to climate change only under prescribed warming
scenarios

   Exposure to water scarcity, as measured with the WCI, increases
   non-linearly with global mean temperature and there are clear overlaps
   between the ranges for increases and decreases in exposure across CMIP3
   models (as observed under the SRES scenarios) in relative (Fig. 4) and
   absolute (Online Resource 13) terms. Exposure to water scarcity
   increases steeply up to 2 °C in many regions (North Africa, East
   Africa, Mashriq, Arabian Peninsula and South Asia) and then stabilises
   by 4 °C. This is because by this point all the watersheds that see a
   decrease in precipitation experience a significant decrease; beyond
   this point there are no further areas where precipitation decreases
   significantly. With a higher threshold for the definition of
   ‘significant’ change, the limit would obviously occur at a higher
   global mean temperature. Global exposure to an increase (decrease) in
   water scarcity with HadCM3 by 2050 and assuming A1B for 1, 2, 3 and
   4 °C prescribed warming, is 760 (1807), 973 (1872), 1055 (1897) and
   1161 (1905) million people respectively, but the uncertainty range
   across all CMIP3 models is considerable.

4 Discussion and conclusions

   Our estimate of present-day populations living within watersheds
   exposed to water scarcity (1.6 and 2.4 billion) is consistent with
   other studies that have published estimates around 2.4 billion (Oki and
   Kanae 2006), 1.4 and 2.2 billion (Arnell 2004), 1.7 and 2.3 billion
   (Revenga et al. 2000), 1.6 and 2.4 billion (Arnell et al. 2011), 1.2
   billion (Hayashi et al. 2010), and 1.6 and 2.3 billion (Alcamo et al.
   2007); the ranges are due to the application of different measures of
   water scarcity. By 2050, the effects of population increases alone mean
   that 3.1 and 4.3 billion people (37 and 53 %) will be living in
   watersheds exposed to water scarcity, which is similar to previous
   estimates around 3.4 and 5.6 billion (39 and 48 %) (Arnell 2004), 3.7
   and 4.2 billion (42 and 47 %) (Arnell et al. 2011), and 3.8 billion
   (40 %) (Hayashi et al. 2010).

   Direct comparisons of projected changes in exposure to water scarcity
   with other studies is not straightforward because of the application of
   different climate models, emissions and population scenarios,
   hydrological models, and measures of water scarcity. An additional
   issue that complicates inter-study comparisons is the spatial scale at
   which water scarcity is calculated. We estimated watershed population
   exposure to water scarcity and aggregated this to the national scale
   and then to the regional scale. Alternative approaches have conducted
   analyses at the scale of individual grid cells (Oki and Kanae 2006;
   Vörösmarty et al. 2000), countries (Oki et al. 2001) and food
   production units (Kummu et al. 2010). While the above comparisons do
   not account for these differences, a tentative comparison can be made,
   however, with two studies that both used a previous version of the
   hydrological model we applied and a WCI threshold of
   1,000 m^3/capita/year to define water scarcity at the watershed scale
   (then aggregating to country and regional scales). Arnell (2004)
   calculated a global increase in exposure (in billions of people) by
   2055 under A2 of 1.1 to 2.8, across 6 GCMS. Our estimates by 2050 under
   A2 are 0.7 to 4.7, across 21 GCMs. Arnell et al. (2011) used a
   “Reference” scenario that is comparable to A1B and calculated a global
   increase in exposure by 2050 of 0.5 to 1.5 billion across 4 GCMs. Our
   estimate under A1B is 0.5 to 3.1 billion, across 21 GCMs.

   Compared with these two studies, our estimates present a wider range
   that encapsulates both, but with very little difference at the
   lower-end and a considerable increase at the upper-end (over 1 billion
   people). This is because our assessment considered many more patterns
   of climate change from GCMs than either of the two studies. Some of the
   GCMs we used will simulate lower precipitation with climate change than
   those used by Arnell (2004) and Arnell et al. (2011). In absolute
   terms, uncertainty in the effects of climate change on water scarcity
   due to the application of all CMIP3 models is greatest for South Asia
   and East Asia, since these are two regions where GCMs show large
   differences in the magnitude, and sometimes sign, of precipitation
   change (Meehl et al. 2007b), and hence runoff change. Thus a
   substantial proportion of the uncertainty in the global-scale effect of
   climate change on water scarcity is due to uncertainties in estimating
   the effects in South Asia and East Asia.

   The shape of the distribution of exposure across all CMIP3 models
   varies by region and type of exposure. This means that climate change
   impacts studies should try to use climate change projections from an
   ensemble of climate models that best represent the range across all
   GCMs available. It is not always computationally feasible to use all
   members of an ensemble (e.g. the CMIP3 models), however, and in such
   cases a careful and thoughtful selection of GCMs should be made, e.g.
   by considering where each GCM sits on the range of all GCMs in the
   ensemble. Otherwise there is a risk of selecting only GCMs that
   represent either the tail, or part of a bimodal distribution, for
   instance, and thus underestimating or overestimating the range of
   possible outcomes. While GCM performance metrics present a method for
   the selection of GCMs in impact studies (Wilby 2010), there remains a
   strong argument that all available GCMs should be used regardless
   because there is no difference in the projections from “better” GCMs
   when compared with “weaker” GCMs, at least where precipitation
   projections are of relevance (Chiew et al. 2009). Moreover, no single
   GCM may consistently out-perform all others when variables beyond
   precipitation only are considered (Gleckler et al. 2008).

   We found that some climate change patterns result in more people
   exposed to an increase in water scarcity than people exposed to a
   decrease, at the global-scale (note that a “net water scarcity change”
   cannot be calculated by summing the increase and decrease in exposure
   for the reasons outlined by Arnell et al. (2011)). This contrasts with
   previous studies that used many less climate change patterns than we
   applied here and found consistently that a greater proportion of the
   global population is exposed to a decrease in water scarcity than an
   increase (Arnell 2004; Hayashi et al. 2010). The sensitivity of
   relative increases and decreases in exposure to climate change pattern
   adds weight to the argument that all available GCMs should be used in
   water resource climate change impact assessments, where possible.

   Similar to earlier work (Gosling et al. 2010; Arnell 2004), we found
   that projections of water scarcity are substantially more sensitive to
   climate change pattern than emissions scenario. However, this
   assessment has highlighted an appreciable sensitivity to the water
   scarcity indicator threshold that is used. Moreover, this is an
   important caveat of our analysis, since all estimates of water scarcity
   presented here are based upon global-scale generalisations about what
   it means to be in a situation of water scarcity. In particular, the
   application of the WSI is traditionally based upon water withdrawals
   instead of actual consumption. To some extent, this could mean that
   water scarcity measured by the WSI is overestimated in watersheds where
   withdrawn water is predominantly used either several times (e.g.
   hydropower) or returned downstream for other users instead of being
   consumed (e.g. some parts of the US). However, this limitation is less
   relevant to locations where water withdrawals are used predominantly
   for irrigation, where the water is also consumed and not returned to
   the system.

   Average annual runoff was used as input to the water resources model.
   Thus in our modelling approach, an increase in average annual runoff
   can benefit society through a decrease in water scarcity. On the other
   hand, however, this could be tempered by an increase in flood risk,
   which we did not consider in this study, but we have elsewhere (Arnell
   and Gosling 2013). Other caveats include assumptions involving the
   parameters used both in the pattern-scaling (Todd et al. 2011) and
   Mac-PDM.09 (Gosling and Arnell 2011), and the assumed rates of
   population change (for each SRES scenario only one population
   projection was used). Additionally, by using a single global
   hydrological model we considerably underestimated hydrological model
   uncertainty, which only recently has been shown to be appreciable
   (Hagemann et al. 2013) but we note that Haddeland et al. (2011) showed
   that under present-day climate forcing, Mac-PDM.09 was located towards
   the middle of the range in simulated runoff across 5 global
   hydrological models. The net effect of these caveats is that the
   estimates of exposure to water scarcity should not to be taken too
   literally as actual impacts or “hardship” but rather as an indication
   of the relative effects of different emissions, climate and population
   scenarios.

   We conducted this assessment at a time when a new set of global change
   scenarios was being released; the GCMs of CMIP5 (Taylor et al. 2011)
   with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; van Vuuren et al.
   (2011)) and the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs; Kriegler et al.
   (2012)). A comparison of our CMIP3 SRES A2 simulations to CMIP5 RCP8.5
   SSP3 (see Online Resource 14 for methods and results) suggests that our
   conclusions are robust across the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models because the
   estimates of water scarcity are broadly consistent.

Abstract

   Previous research has postulated that climate change will lead to mass
   migration. However, the linkages postulated between the two have not
   been explicitly demonstrated but have rather been derived from ‘common
   sense’. In this paper, the connection between climate change and
   migration via two mechanisms, sea level rise and floods, is
   investigated and depicted in conceptual models. In both cases, a
   connection can be traced and the linkages are made explicit. However,
   the study also clearly shows that the connection is by no means
   deterministic but depends on numerous factors relating to the
   vulnerability of the people and the region in question.

Abstract

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has
   estimated that in 2010–2012, 868 million people were undernourished
   worldwide. At the same time, FAO reported that approximately 1.3
   billion tons of food were lost or wasted globally in 2007, which was
   equivalent to approximately one-third of the food produced for human
   consumption at the time. Food losses and waste deprive the poor living
   in developing regions of opportunities to access food, cause
   significant depletion of resources such as land, water, and fossil
   fuels, and increase the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food
   production. In the present study, the effects of reducing food losses
   and waste on global food security, natural resources, and greenhouse
   gas emissions were evaluated using a food trade model operating under
   the assumption that in 2007, developed regions, as defined by the FAO,
   would reduce food losses and waste by up to 50 % during the stages of
   postharvest handling and storage, processing and packaging,
   distribution, and consumption. The results obtained show quantitatively
   that reductions in food losses in developed regions decrease the number
   of undernourished people in developing regions by up to 63 million,
   leading to decreases in the harvested area, water utilization, and
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production.

Appendix 1: Simple method for estimating per capita income change

   The per capita income for region r in the base year 2007, pcINC[
   r,base], is defined as follows:
   $$ {\text{pcINC}}_{\text{r,base}} = {\text{GDE}}_{\text{r,base}}
   /{\text{POP}}_{\text{r, base}} $$
   (1)
   where GDE[r,base] is the GDE and POP[r,base] is the total population in
   the base year.
   After the reduction of food losses and food waste in developed regions,
   per capita income in developing regions, pcINC[r], is recalculated
   simply by revising the GDE[r] as follows:
   $$ {\text{pcINC}}_{\text{r}} = {\text{GDE}}_{\text{r}}
   /{\text{POP}}_{\text{r,base}} $$
   (2)
   $$ \begin{aligned} {\text{GDE}}_{\text{r}} & = \sum\limits_{i} {\left(
   {{\text{AgGDE}}_{{{\text{CN}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}\, { \cdot
   }\,\frac{{{\text{PC}}_{i}\, { \cdot }\,{\text{QF}}_{i}
   }}{{{\text{PC}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}}\, { \cdot
   }\,{\text{QF}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}} \right)} \\ & \quad +
   \sum\limits_{i} {\left(
   {{\text{AgGDE}}_{{{\text{EX}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}\, { \cdot
   }\,\frac{{{\text{PW}}_{i}\, { \cdot }\,{\text{QEX}}_{i}
   }}{{{\text{PW}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}}\, { \cdot
   }\,{\text{QEX}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}} \right)} \\ & \quad -
   \sum\limits_{i} {\left(
   {{\text{AgGDE}}_{{{\text{IM}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}\, { \cdot
   }\,\frac{{{\text{PW}}_{i}\, { \cdot }\,{\text{QIM}}_{i}
   }}{{{\text{PW}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}}\, { \cdot
   }\,{\text{QIM}}_{{i,{\text{base}}}} }}} \right)} +
   {\text{RtGDE}}_{\text{r,base}} \\ \end{aligned} $$
   (3)
   where PC[ i ]and PW[ i ]are consumer and world prices; QF[ i ], QEX[ i
   ]and QIM[ i ]are consumer demand, exports and imports, respectively,
   for food commodity i after the reduction of food losses and food waste
   in developed regions; and AgGDE_CN[ i,base], AgGDE_EX[ i,base], and
   AgGDE_IM[ i,base] are agricultural consumption, exports, and imports,
   respectively, in the base year. RtGDE[r,base] is determined by
   subtracting these agricultural terms from gross domestic expenditure,
   GDE[r,base] values taken from the GTAP8 database (Narayanan et al.
   2012).
   Although the expenditure for the other goods (RtGDE[r]) is assumed to
   be constant at the base year level in the formula (3), it could be
   reduced due to food wastage reduction in developed regions for the
   following two relations. First, RtGDE[r] could be reduced due to the
   price decrease of food considering substitution between food and the
   other goods. Generally, the more substitutable with other goods, the
   more elastic to the price the demand of good tends to be. As is shown
   in Table 13, food demand is less elastic to the price than the other
   goods are, which means food has little substitution goods. Therefore,
   RtGDE[r] might be reduced slightly due to the decreases of food prices
   in developing regions. Secondly, RtGDE[r] could be reduced due to
   agricultural income reduction arising from the decreases of food price
   and food production in developing regions because the other goods are
   more elastic to income than food is (Table 13). Consequently, GDEs
   (GDPs) in developing regions could be reduced further due to the
   decrease of RtGDE[r], which leads to the increase in the number of
   undernourished people for developing regions.

Appendix 2: The FAO methodology for assessing food insecurity: a skew-normal
distributional model

   In 2012, the FAO methodology for estimating the prevalence of
   undernourishment went through a review to choose the most appropriate
   model to describe the dietary energy consumption of the population and
   improve the estimation of its parameters. A skew-normal distribution
   (Azzalini 1985) was adopted as a result of this review (FAO, WFP, IFAD
   2012). In the model, the proportion of undernourished individuals in
   the total population is defined by the following cumulative
   distribution function:
   $$ F({\text{MDER}}) = \varPhi \left( {\frac{{{\text{MDER}} - \xi
   }}{\omega }} \right) - 2\,{\text{Owen}}T\left( {\frac{{{\text{MDER}} -
   \xi }}{\omega },\alpha } \right) $$
   (4)
   where MDER is the minimum dietary energy requirement (kcal/person/day)
   and ω, ξ, and α are scale, location, and shape parameters,
   respectively. Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard
   normal distribution and OwenT is Owen’s T function. These two
   parameters are defined as follows:
   $$ \varPhi (x) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ {1 + {\text{erf}}\left(
   {\frac{x}{\sqrt 2 }} \right)} \right]( - \infty < x < + \infty ) $$
   (5)
   $$ {\text{Owen}}T(h,a) = \frac{1}{2\pi }\int\limits_{0}^{a}
   {\frac{{{\text{e}}^{{ - \frac{1}{2}h^{2} \left( {1 + x^{2} } \right)}}
   }}{{1 + x^{2} }}} {\text{d}}x( - \infty < h,a < + \infty ) $$
   (6)
   where erf is the error function.
   The values of the scale, location, and shape parameters are derived
   from the mean, variance, coefficient of variation (CV), and skewness of
   the distribution and the food loss rate (Loss), as follows:
   $$ {\text{Mean}} = {\text{DES}}{ \cdot }\left( {1 - {\text{Loss}}}
   \right) = \xi + \omega \delta \sqrt {\frac{2}{\pi }\;}\,
   {\text{where}}\;\delta = \frac{\alpha }{{\sqrt {1 + \alpha^{2} } }} $$
   (7)
   $$ {\text{Variance}} = \omega^{2} (1 - (2\delta^{2} )/\pi ) $$
   (8)
   $$ {\text{CV}} = \frac{{\sqrt {\text{Variance}} }}{\text{Mean}} $$
   (9)
   $$ {\text{Skewness}} = \frac{4 - \pi }{2}{ \cdot }\frac{{\left( {\delta
   \sqrt {2/\pi } } \right)^{3} }}{{(1 - 2\delta^{2} /\pi )^{3/2} }} $$
   (10)
   where DES is the average dietary energy supply (kcal/person/day), which
   is computed from the per capita consumption of food commodities
   (kg/person/year) as the outcome of the modified PEATSim model. Finally,
   the number of undernourished people is determined by multiplying the
   proportion of undernourished people by the total population.

Appendix 3: How to calculate the reduction target for food losses and food
waste in developed regions

   In the modified PEATSim model, the regional food balance for each
   commodity in 2007 is expressed as follows:
   $$ {\text{QS}}0 + {\text{QIM}}0 - {\text{QEX}}0 + {\text{QSt}}0 =
   {\text{QL}}0 + {\text{QR}}0 + {\text{QP}}0 + {\text{QE}}0 +
   {\text{QF}}0 $$
   (11)
   where QS0, QIM0, QEX0, and QSt0 on the left-hand side are production,
   import, export, and stock variation, respectively, and QL0, QR0, QE0,
   QP0, and QF0 on the right-hand side are feed, seed, other utility,
   processing, and consumer demand, respectively, derived from the food
   balance sheets in FAOSTAT (FAO 2012).

   In the following formulas for calculating food wastage, QW0 represents
   food losses in the postharvest handling and storage stages in 2007,
   derived from “waste” in the commodity balances in FAOSTAT, which is
   included in the other utility (QE0) in the food balance sheets. QE, QP,
   and QF are the other utility, processing, and consumer demand,
   respectively, in developed regions after reduction of food losses and
   food waste, which are fixed at the reduced levels during simulation
   processes. R [m], R [p], R [d], and R [c] are the ratios of waste
   generation in the milling, processing and packaging, distribution, and
   consumption stages, respectively, in the SIK report (Gustavsson et al.
   2013). R [r] is the target reduction ratio for food losses and food
   waste for all food commodities, which is taken as the maximum of 0.5 in
   the present study. S [QE], S [QP], and S [QF] are the maximum reduction
   quantities for other utility, processing, and consumer demand,
   respectively, in the model.

Cereals

   Food losses and food waste are generated as follows at each stage of
   the food supply chain:

   Postharvest handling and storage: QW0

   Milling: R [m] · QF0

   Processing and packaging: R [p] · QP0 + R [p] · (1 − R [m]) · QF0

   Distribution: R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · (1 − R
   [m]) · QF0

   Consumption: R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [c] · (1 − R
   [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · (1 − R [m]) · QF0

   Therefore, the maximum reduction quantity for each demand is calculated
   as follows:

   Other utility (S [QE]): QW0

   Processing (S [QP]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d])
   · (1 − R [p])] · QP0

   Consumer (S [QF]): [R [m] + R [p] · (1 − R [m]) + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) ·
   (1 − R [m]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · (1 − R [m])] · QF0

Oilseed crops and vegetable oils

   Food losses and food waste are generated as follows at each stage of
   the food supply chain:

   Postharvest handling and storage: QW0[crop]

   Processing and packaging: R [p] · QP0[oil] + R [p]/(1 − R [p]) ·
   QF0[oil]

   Distribution: R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QP0[oil] + R [d] · [1 − R
   [p]/(1 − R [p])] · QF0[oil] + R [d] · QF0[crop]

   Consumption: R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QP0[oil] + R [c] ·
   (1 − R [d]) · [1 − R [p]/(1 − R [p])] · QF0[oil] + R [c] · (1 − R [d])
   · QF0[crop]

   Therefore, the maximum reduction quantity for each demand is calculated
   as follows:

   Other utility (S [QE,crop]): QW0[crop]

   Processing (S [QP,oil]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R
   [d]) · (1 − R [p])] · QP0[oil]

   Consumer (S [QF,oil]): {R [p]/(1 − R [p]) + R [d] · [1 − R [p]/(1 − R
   [p])] + R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · [1 − R [p]/(1 − R [p])]} · QF0[oil]

   Consumer (S [QF,crop]): [R [d] + R [c] · (1 − R [d])] · QF0[crop]

Livestock products

   Food losses and food waste are generated as follows at each stage of
   the food supply chain:

   Postharvest handling and storage: QW0

   Processing and packaging: R [p] · QP0 + R [p] · QF0

   Distribution: R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) · QF0

   Consumption: R [c] · (1 − R [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QP0 + R [c] · (1 − R
   [d]) · (1 − R [p]) · QF0

   Therefore, the maximum reduction quantity for each demand is calculated
   as follows:

   Other utility (S [QE]): QW0

   Processing (S [QP]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d])
   · (1 − R [p])] · QP0

   Consumer (S [QF]): [R [p] + R [d] · (1 − R [p]) + R [c] · (1 − R [d]) ·
   (1 − R [p])] · QF0

   Consequently, other utility, processing, and consumer demands in
   developed regions after reducing food losses and food waste, namely,
   QE, QP, and QF, respectively, amount to (QE0 − R [r] · S [QE]),
   (QP0 − R [r] · S [QP]), and (QF0 − R [r] · S [QF]), respectively, which
   are fixed at these levels during simulation processes.

Abstract

   In two experiments, the claim was tested that the font “Dyslexie”,
   specifically designed for people with dyslexia, eases reading
   performance of children with (and without) dyslexia. Three questions
   were investigated. (1) Does the Dyslexie font lead to faster and/or
   more accurate reading? (2) Do children have a preference for the
   Dyslexie font? And, (3) is font preference related to reading
   performance? In Experiment 1, children with dyslexia (n = 170) did not
   read text written in Dyslexie font faster or more accurately than in
   Arial font. The majority preferred reading in Arial and preference was
   not related to reading performance. In Experiment 2, children with
   (n = 102) and without dyslexia (n = 45) read word lists in three
   different font types (Dyslexie, Arial, Times New Roman). Words written
   in Dyslexie font were not read faster or more accurately. Moreover,
   participants showed a preference for the fonts Arial and Times New
   Roman rather than Dyslexie, and again, preference was not related to
   reading performance. These experiments clearly justify the conclusion
   that the Dyslexie font neither benefits nor impedes the reading process
   of children with and without dyslexia.

   Dyslexia Font Reading

   Dyslexia is a problem with the acquisition of reading decoding and/or
   spelling. These problems are not accompanied by intellectual
   disabilities and remain despite intensive instruction and practice
   (Lyon, Shaywitz, & Shaywitz, 2003). Scientific research that aims at a
   causal explanation for reading and spelling problems (henceforth,
   dyslexia) is omnipresent (Wijnants, Hasselman, Cox, Bosman, & Van
   Orden, 2012). The strongest theoretical perspective on dyslexia is
   problems with phonology (Lyon et al., 2003; Shaywitz, Morris, &
   Shaywitz, 2008; Snowling, 2011; Vellutino & Fletcher, 2005; Vellutino,
   Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004). Phonology refers to the sound of
   spoken words. The ability to read requires the reader to decode each
   letter or letter cluster into its sounds or phonemes. Spelling requires
   the opposite, the segmentation of spoken words into its constituent
   phonemes and recoding them into visual symbols. Most remediation
   techniques, therefore, rely on strengthening phonologically based
   skills and proved to be successful when the approach includes visual
   presentation of written words (Duff & Clarke, 2011; Morais, 1991;
   Pennington, Peterson, & McGrath, 2009; Shaywitz et al., 2008; Snowling
   & Hulme, 2011; Tijms, 2011).

   Although studies on the relationship between phonological skills and
   reading performance are relatively consistent, other research suggests
   a relationship between reading skill and vision (e.g., Irlen & Lass,
   1989; Lovegrove, Martin, & Slaghuis, 1986; Orton, 1937; Stein & Walsh,
   1997). In fact, the first written account on a child who appeared to be
   unable to read was by the British medical doctor Kerr (1897) who
   describes “…a boy with word blindness, who can spell the separate
   letters…” (p. 668). The term word blindness reveals the assumption of a
   visual origin of the reading and spelling problem.

   The most persistent perspective on the relationship between a visual
   problem and reading performance is the magnocellular theory of dyslexia
   (Stein & Walsh, 1997). Visual sensitivity is insufficiently suppressed
   by the magnocellular system when reading, such that fixations from one
   place in the text to the other cannot be distinguished properly.
   Evidence for this assumption is equivocal (Amitay, Ben-Yehudah, Banai,
   & Ahissar, 2002; Stein, 2014; Stein & Walsh, 1997; see Gori & Facoetti,
   2014, for an extensive overview of visual theories and potential,
   albeit debatable, treatments).

   A somewhat older explanation put forward by Irlen and Lass (1989) is
   that poor readers may suffer from the so-called ‘scotopic sensitivity
   syndrome’, which refers to difficulties with a light source, glare,
   luminance, wave length, and black/white contrast. Irlen’s solution was
   to provide readers with tinted glasses or overlays. The evidence for
   the effectiveness of this treatment is also far from conclusive (e.g.,
   Blaskey et al., 1990; Goldstand, Koslowe, & Parush, 2005; Henderson,
   Tsogka, & Snowling, 2013; Irlen & Lass, 1989).

   Yet another reason for poor reading performance has been sought in
   typographical characteristics of text. The fact that children’s books
   for learning to read have a larger font size than books for more
   advanced readers reflects the idea that typographical properties affect
   the reading decoding process (Bernard, Chaparro, Mills, & Halcomb,
   2002; Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011; Wilkins, Cleave, Grayson, & Wilson,
   2009; Woods, Davis, & Scharff, 2005). Legibility is thought to be
   affected by the following font characteristics: x-height, body size,
   character and interline spacing, and shape (i.e., weight, contrast,
   serif or sans serif types, italic, bold etc.). Each will be discussed
   in detail below.

Typographical characteristics

   The body size of a font refers to the height of the letter, measured
   from the lowest point of the descender until the top of the ascender,
   supplemented with a minimal amount of extra space which is needed in
   order to prevent that letters will touch other letters (Legge &
   Bigelow, 2011; Spelbrink, 2012). Font size is measured in points (pt).
   A point is about 0.353 mm or 1/72 of an inch. Fonts with body sizes
   between 9 and 12 points (Bolder et al., 1990) or between 9 and 11
   points (Unger, 2006) are considered to be legible.

   The x-height of a font is the height of the lowercase letter x, given a
   certain point size (Legge & Bigelow, 2011; Spelbrink, 2012). Fonts with
   a relatively large x-height are more legible than fonts with a smaller
   x-height (Bernard et al., 2002; Dobres, Chrysler, Wolfe, Chahine, &
   Reimer, 2017; Legge & Bigelow, 2011; Williams, 2001). Note, however,
   that extreme large or extreme small x-heights might have a negative
   impact on reading performances (Williams, 2001). In children’s books,
   x-height generally decreases with increasing reading age (Hughes &
   Wilkins, 2000).

   The character and interline spacing of a font refer to the space
   between the letters and space between the lines and surrounding texts
   (Unger, 2006). Proportionally spaced fonts are considered to be more
   legible than monospaced (fixed character width; Gelderman, 1998).
   Gianotten (2014a), a Dutch expert in typography, maintains that a
   larger font, extra interline space, and adding extra space between
   letters positively contribute to legibility (see also, Perea, Panadero,
   Moret-Tatay, & Gómez, 2012). Hughes and Wilkins (2000) examined the
   combined effects of x-height, line spacing, word spacing, and line
   length. They found that reading speed of young children (aged 5 to
   7 years) decreased when the size of the text decreased. However,
   reading speed of older children (aged 8 to 11 years) was not affected
   by the size of the texts. For accuracy, they found an effect for all
   age groups; more errors were made on smaller texts compared to larger
   (Hughes & Wilkins, 2000).

   The shape of a font is determined by weight, contrast, being serif or
   sans serif, and italic or regular. Font weight refers to boldness. Font
   contrast is the ratio between thin and thick parts. Serif fonts are
   letters that have small lines added to the edge of letters, such as in
   Times New Roman or Cambria; fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and Calibiri
   are so-called sans serif fonts, because they lack lines trailing of the
   edges. Historically, serif fonts are considered to be more legible than
   sans serif fonts, since serifs make letters more distinguishable
   (McLean, 1980) and because it accentuates the end of the strokes
   (Rubinstein, 1988). Empirical findings concerning the effect on reading
   performances are, however, inconclusive (Gelderman, 1998; Unger, 2006).
   Some studies showed that sans serif fonts benefit reading outcomes
   (Kaspar, Wehlitz, von Knobelsdorff, Wulf, & von Saldern, 2015;
   Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011; Woods et al., 2005). Others showed that
   serifs might only be beneficial for reading when the size of the
   letters is small, probably due to the fact that serif fonts have a
   slightly increased letters space (Arditi & Cho, 2005; Kaspar et al.,
   2015). Finally, we mention that italic or bold fonts may affect
   legibility negatively compared to regular fonts (Bolder et al., 1990;
   Williams, 2001).

   Thus, legibility appears to be affected by a number of different
   characteristics of a font. These characteristics are, however, often
   interrelated. An example is a font that is changed from a regular one
   into an italic one. It is not just the angle of the letters that
   changes, but also the space between the letter; there is often less
   inter-letter space in an italic font than in a regular one. To study
   the effect of each of these properties separately is therefore not
   easy, and perhaps even impossible (Moret-Tatay & Perea, 2011;
   Russell-Minda et al., 2007).

   Font characteristics and dyslexia

   Only a few studies have focused on the effects of adjusting texts for
   people with dyslexia. A first conclusion that can be drawn from these
   studies is that font size matters. O’Brien, Mansfield, and Legge (2005)
   argue that children with dyslexia need a larger print size to support
   maximum reading speed compared to children with a typical reading
   development. A second conclusion is that no differences were observed
   in reading times of participants with dyslexia reading texts in sans
   serif or serif fonts (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013). We need to add that
   the mean age of the participants was 20 years with the youngest being
   11 and the oldest 50. The effect of serif may turn out to be different
   for younger children with reading difficulties. The British Dyslexia
   Association (2014) recommends a sans serif font, although they do not
   refer to research to substantiate this advice. A third conclusion is
   that no differences in reading times were found for participants with
   dyslexia when texts were read in regular compared to italic fonts
   (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013). A final conclusion is that children with
   dyslexia may benefit from extra inter-letter spacing (Perea et al.,
   2012; Zorzi et al., 2012), but seem not to benefit from either
   monospaced or proportionally spaced fonts (Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013).
   Note again that these null-findings in the work of Rello and
   Baeza-Yates (2013) are based on reading performance of older readers;
   typographical characteristics may have different effects in children
   who start to learn to read. Gianotten (2014b) suggested that dyslectics
   could benefit from larger fonts and more horizontal space and that
   larger interline space could lead to better reading performance. This
   assumption was recently challenged in a paper by van den Boer and
   Hakvoort (2015). They asked Dutch beginning (Grade 2) and more advanced
   readers (Grade 4), including a subsample of poor readers, to read a
   list of 144 words with varying interletter spacing. The results showed
   that none of the groups benefitted from extra, that is, above default
   interletter spacing of a 14-point Times New Roman font. Reduced
   interletter spacing (below the default value), however, affected
   reading fluency negatively in all groups.

   Although the relationship between reading problems and font
   characteristics is not yet clear, recent developments provide an
   opportunity to study the role of typographical characteristics in more
   depth. A number of different fonts have been created specifically for
   readers with dyslexia, such as “OpenDyslexic” (Gonzalez, 2015),
   “ReadRegularTM” (French, 2003), “Sylexiad” (Hillier, 2008), and the
   “Dyslexie font” © of Boer (2015). The designers of these fonts
   emphasize two main aspects, namely, differences between letters and
   weighted bottoms. The focus in the experiments testing the effect of
   font concerned reading performance and font preference. Rello and
   Baeza-Yates (2013) compared reading performance of participants with
   dyslexia while using two fonts that were created for people with
   dyslexia (i.e., OpenDyslexic and OpenDyslexic Italic) and ten other
   fonts that were not specifically designed for people with dyslexia.
   Reading text in OpenDyslexic or in OpenDyslexic Italic did not lead to
   a decrease in reading time compared to the other ten fonts. Moreover,
   participants did not show a preference for the font OpenDyslexic. They
   preferred Verdana and Helvetica to OpenDyslexic (Rello & Baeza-Yates,
   2013). Zikl et al. (2015) did not find significant differences either
   in reading speed and accuracy when the font OpenDyslexic was compared
   to Arial. Wery and Diliberto (2016) found similar results for reading
   rate and accuracy when they compared this font to Arial and Times New
   Roman.

   The font that is the object of this study concerns Christian Boer’s
   Dyslexie font launched in 2009. Boer (2015) claims that Dyslexie-letter
   shapes are more distinguishable than other fonts as a result of adding
   extra weight to the bottom of the letters using more oblique letters,
   enlarged openings within letters, different shapes, enlarged ascenders
   and descenders, punctuation and capitals in bold, different heights for
   almost similar letters, increased x-height, and more space between the
   letters.

   Although, this Dutch graphic designer claims that his font has positive
   effects on reading performance of dyslectics, there are no empirical
   studies that substantiate this. Boer (2011) supports his conjecture by
   referring to a study conducted by de Leeuw (2010), a master student
   from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. In her study, she had
   university students with (n = 21) and without dyslexia (n = 22) perform
   two reading tasks (i.e., word reading and pseudoword reading). They
   were asked to read both tests in Arial font as well as in Dyslexie
   font. Her conclusion was that no differences in reading speed between
   the task presented in Dyslexie font and Arial font emerged for either
   the students with or students without dyslexia. She also concluded that
   dyslectic students read more accurately in the Dyslexie font.
   Unfortunately, this could not be verified, because no proper
   statistical proof was presented. She also concluded that children with
   dyslexia had a more positive attitude towards the font Dyslexie. This
   conclusion could not be verified either, because again no statistical
   test was done to underpin this statement.

   In 2013, another master study was conducted at the University of Twente
   concerning the effect of the Dyslexie font on reading performance. This
   study by Pijpker (2013) targeted reading skill of children with
   (n = 22) and without (n = 42) dyslexia aged between 8 and 12 years
   attending a regular primary school. Each child read four different
   texts, that each had two levels of difficulty. Again, reading in
   Dyslexie font did not lead to a decrease in reading time or reading
   errors compared to reading in Arial in either the readers with or
   without dyslexia. When they divided the dyslectic readers in a group
   that read relatively well (n = 9) and one that read relatively poorly
   (n = 13), they found an effect of font in the poor dyslectic readers
   group, that is, they made fewer errors when reading the Dyslexie font
   than when reading in Arial.

   Recently, Marinus et al. (2016) compared Arial with Dyslexie in 39
   English-reading low-performing readers at text level. In a condition
   where they had not controlled for spacing, the Dyslexie font seemed to
   have a slight advantage over Arial (7% more words were read per
   minute), but after the fonts were matched for within-word and
   between-word spacing the effect disappeared. The authors therefore
   concluded that if the font Dyslexie aids reading, it is not because of
   its shape but rather because of the increase in word spacing. Thus, the
   claim by the designer Boer that letter shapes are responsible for the
   assumed increased legibility is doubtful (Marinus et al., 2016).
   Criticism on Boer’s claim also comes from the profession of typography.
   Gianotten (2014a, 2015), for example, questioned a couple of Boer’s
   typographical adaptations. One, the statement that the x-height of the
   Dyslexie font is larger than the x-height of other fonts is not
   correct. The x-height is a percentage of the capital height and body
   size (relative x-height). As shown in Table 1, the x-height of the
   Dyslexie font is 63% of the capital height and smaller than those of
   Arial and Times New Roman, and the x-height related to body size of the
   Dyslexie font is smaller than the relative x-height of the other two
   fonts.

   Two, Bessemans (2012) and Gianotten (2014a, 2015) state that the body
   size of the Dyslexie font is larger than Boer (2015) claims. Extra
   interline space is added by the designer resulting in an amount of
   interline space that is not in accordance with point size. As a result
   of this, the notation of corps size is incorrect.

   Three, according to Boer (2015), letters in the font Dyslexie are more
   distinct from each other than letters in other fonts and according to
   the designer this is its main effective characteristic. It has been
   suggested that specific subgroups, like children who are at the
   beginning of the reading process, people with visual disabilities, and
   children with dyslexia might benefit from fonts that are more
   distinctive (Pohlen, 2009; Unger, 2006). Williams (2001) argues that
   fonts that require more attention causes a text to be less readable,
   because the reader’s focus has to be shifted from the content of the
   text to the letter shapes. Wilkins et al. (2009) investigated this
   hypothesis and compared the reading performances in two fonts, namely
   Sassoon Primary and Verdana. Sassoon Primary letters are less
   distinctive than those of Verdana. Results showed that words written in
   Verdana font were read and searched more quickly by typical reading
   children than words written in Sassoon Primary font. Reading letters
   that are more distinctive might be beneficial to reading outcomes, this
   is in accordance with Boer’s statements. However, Marinus et al. (2016)
   have shown that, compared to the font Arial, the letters of the font
   Dyslexie are less distinct from one another.

   Reading is an important skill, and problems in reading can affect a
   person’s life in several ways. If a change in font eases the problems
   of people who have difficulty reading or learning to read, then it is
   the duty of scientists to share this knowledge. It is, however, also a
   scientist’s duty to test claims made by people to avoid
   disappointments, investments, and false hope. This study aims to
   contribute to sound scientific knowledge regarding the assumed effects
   of the font Dyslexie.

The present study

   The main goal, therefore, is to investigate whether the Dyslexie font
   is, as claimed by Boer, beneficial for readers with dyslexia. In two
   experiments, we will compare the effect of the Dyslexie font with the
   sans serif font Arial, recommended by the British Dyslexia Association
   (2014), and a wide-spread used standard serif font Times New Roman. To
   increase the possibility of finding differences between fonts,
   participants will be asked to read lists of unconnected words as well
   as texts. Because the focus of this study was the effect of font shape
   rather than interline spacing and font size, we controlled for these
   typographical aspects in the best way possible (more details in the
   Method sections).

   To avoid a confound with word or text characteristics, a full
   within-subjects design will be used. That is, participants will be
   asked to read the same texts or words written in different type faces.
   Experimental measures (see Method sections) will be taken to control
   for the so-called repetition effect, that is, the effect that a
   repeated reading of text or words is generally faster than a first
   reading (Lowder, Choi, & Gordon, 2013; Oliphant, 1983; Scarborough,
   Cortese, & Scarborough, 1977).

   Given earlier empirical findings, we do not expect the Dyslexie font to
   be more helpful in easing reading than Arial and Times New Roman. It
   may, however, be the case that readers who prefer the Dyslexie font
   read more effectively in that font. We therefore asked all participants
   to indicate their preference for a particular font and subsequently
   related this preference to reading performance.

   In sum, the main three questions of the present study are: (1) Does the
   Dyslexie font lead to faster and/or more accurate reading? (2) Do
   participants have a preference for the Dyslexie font? (3) Does a
   preference for a font affect reading performances? The group of
   participants in Experiment 1 consisted solely of children with
   dyslexia, whereas in Experiment 2 both children with and without
   dyslexia took part.

Experiment 1

Method

Participants

   All participants were recruited from an assessment and treatment
   program at Braams & Partners, an institution for learning disorders in
   the Netherlands. They were diagnosed with dyslexia in this clinical
   center, according to the requirements of the Protocol for Dyslexia
   (Blomert, 2006). Children whose standardized test scores on
   word-reading tests were below the tenth percentile or participants with
   standardized test scores on word reading below the 16th percentile and
   whose standardized test scores on word-spelling tests were below the
   10th percentile. Informed consent was obtained from all participants
   and their parents. A total of 170 Dutch children with dyslexia (100
   boys and 70 girls) were included in this study. Ages ranged from
   7;4 years to 12;4 years (M = 119.8 months, SD = 13.7). Participants
   were randomly assigned to two groups, which determined the sequence in
   which the examined fonts were presented. The age of participants in
   Order‘Arial - Dyslexie’ (M = 120.3 months, SD = 14.4) did not differ
   from that of participants in Order‘Dyslexie - Arial’ (M = 119.3 months,
   SD = 13.0), t(168) = .51, p = .61. Moreover, the average text-reading
   skills of the participants in the two groups were the same,
   t(168) = .32, p = .75. The text-reading skills, measured with the AVI
   reading cards (Krom, Jongen, Verhelst, Kamphuis, & Kleintjes, 2010)
   were comparable to those of an average pupil after 22 to 23 months of
   reading education (a little over 2 years).

Materials

   Reading speed and accuracy at text level were measured using the test
   card AVI 3A (Visser, van Laarhoven, & ter Beek, 1994). This test card
   is part of the AVI test package [AVI toets pakket] that contains nine
   test cards of increasing order of difficulty. Scores were based on the
   time participants needed to read the text and the total number of
   errors they made. Reliability is evaluated as “acceptable” (Egberink,
   Janssen, & Vermeulen, 2014a). The test card AVI 3A contains short
   sentences with words of one to four syllables (Visser et al., 1994).
   Two versions of test card 3A were used: one printed in font Arial and
   one printed in font Dyslexie. To correct for extra interline spacing
   and larger letters in the font Dyslexie, adjustments were made to the
   interline spacing and body size. Therefore, we used Arial in body size
   13 (capital height 3.28 mm, x-height 2.38 mm) with 1.35 vertical line
   spacing and the font Dyslexie in body size 12 (capital height 3.95 mm,
   x-height 2.51 mm) with 1.0 vertical line spacing.

Procedure

   Both tests were administered in separate sessions. Half of the children
   were asked to read the card in font Arial first (Time 1) and then in
   font Dyslexie (Time 2), whereas the other half of the participants read
   the cards in the reversed order. The time interval between the two
   sessions was one to 2 weeks. Following the final reading at Time 2, the
   participants were shown both texts and asked whether they had a
   preference for one of the two fonts. To reduce bias, participants were

   Results and Conclusion.

Reading performance

   Two separate 2 (Order: Arial – Dyslexie versus Dyslexie – Arial) × 2
   (Time: 1 versus 2) GLM repeated measures ANOVA’s with age as covariate
   was run on the scores of reading speed and reading accuracy,
   respectively. Time was a within-subjects factor and Order a
   between-subjects factor. The mean scores and standard deviations for
   reading speed and reading accuracy of the two Orders are presented in
   Table 2. As expected, the main effect of Time (i.e., repetition) on
   reading speed was highly significant, F(1, 167) = 33.86, p < .0001, η
   ^2 = 17. Participants read the text at Time 2 considerably faster than
   at Time 1; the number of errors did not decrease significantly after
   repeated reading F(1, 167) = 1.08, p < .30, η ^2 = .006. The effect of
   the covariate was also significant revealing that older students were
   faster readers F(1, 167) = 92.36, p < .0001, η ^2 = .36, and made fewer
   errors, F(1, 167) = 34.55, p < .0001, η ^2 = .17.

   *The Order Arial – Dyslexie refers to the fact that at Time 1 the
   participants read the text in font Arial and at Time 2, they read the
   text in font Dyslexie. For the Order Dyslexie – Arial the order was
   reversed.

   The main effect of Order was not significant with respect to speed or
   accuracy, F < 1, and F(1,167) = 2.78, p = .10, η ^2 = .02,
   respectively. Thus, the order in which the fonts were read did not
   affect reading speed and reading accuracy differentially. The
   interaction effect of Time and Order was also significant with respect
   to reading speed, F(1, 167) = 7.50, p < .007, η ^2 = .04, but not with
   respect to accuracy, F < 1. This interaction will be investigated in
   the following analysis.

   To investigate the question whether reading in the Dyslexie font aids
   reading separate GLM univariate analyses were conducted at Times 1 and
   2 in which Font was a between-subjects factor and age in months served
   as covariate. Reading speed between Arial and Dyslexie did not differ
   significantly at Times 1 and 2, both F’s < 1. The analysis regarding
   accuracy yielded similar non-significant results, Time 1: F(1,
   167) = 1.78, p = .18; Time 2: F(1, 167) = 3.04, p = .08.

Font preference

   In the group of children that read Arial first and Dyslexie second, a
   preference for Arial was shown by 44.7% of the participants, 37.6%
   preferred the font Dyslexie, and the remaining 17.6% did not have a
   preference. In the group of children that read Dyslexie first and Arial
   second, 61.9% had a preference for Arial, 20.2% had a preference for
   Dyslexie, and 17.9% had no preference. The distribution of preferences
   was significantly different for the two groups, χ^2 (2) = 6.76,
   p = .03). Therefore, the effect of preference on reading performance
   was tested separately for the two groups.

Reading performance and font preference

   To test for the effect of preference on reading speed and reading
   errors eight separate Univariate GLM’s were conducted on reading speed
   and reading errors with font preference as independent variable. Age
   served again as covariate. Means, standard deviations, and F tests are
   presented in Table 3. The effect of the covariate was significant in
   all eight analyses. These effects have been discussed in the previous
   analyses.

   *The experimenter forgot to ask one child about her preference;
   analysis was therefore based on 169 children rather than 170.

   Only one of the analyses reached significance, namely the one
   pertaining to Time 1, where students who read the font Dyslexie showed
   a significant main effect of preference. Subsequent Bonferroni
   corrected pairwise comparisons revealed no difference in reading speed
   of the text written in Dyslexie between those who preferred Dyslexie
   font and those who preferred Arial font, p = 1.0. Those without a
   preference, however, were slower in reading the text in Dyslexie than
   those who preferred Dyslexie, p < .02, but were not slower than the
   children who preferred Arial, p = .16.

Conclusion

   Children with dyslexia read text written in font Dyslexie as fast as in
   font Arial and they made a comparable number of errors. Participants
   generally preferred Arial above Dyslexie and preference for either of
   the fonts was not related to better reading. Moreover, the second
   reading of the same text was indeed faster than the first time the text
   was read; the order in which the texts were read did not affect reading
   speed or reading accuracy.

Experiment 2

   In Experiments 2, the claim was tested that the font Dyslexie would
   benefit reading at the word level. The serif font Times New Roman was
   added, because of its widespread use in books. The same questions that
   were investigated in Experiment 1 were subject of investigation in
   Experiment 2. For reason explained below, the repetition effect in this
   experiment is probably limited or even absent.

Method

Participants

   The participant group in Experiment 2 consisted of children with
   dyslexia (n = 102) and without dyslexia (n = 45) who were all attending
   regular primary education. Like in Experiment 1, the participants with
   dyslexia were recruited from Braams & Partners, an institution for
   learning disorders. The selection criteria were equal to those in
   Experiment 1. Participants with dyslexia were recruited from Grades 2
   to 6. Ages ranged from 7;9 years to 12;10 years (M = 123.9 months,
   SD = 14.1). Participants without dyslexia were recruited from Grades 2
   to 4. Ages ranged from 7;6 years to 11;9 years (M = 110.2 months,
   SD = 12.9).

   Informed consent was obtained from all participants and their parents.
   Participants were randomly assigned to one of three Font-order
   conditions (see Procedure). There were no significant differences
   between the age of the participants in the three Font-order conditions,
   F < 1. Moreover, the average text-reading skills of the participants in
   the three Font-order conditions were the same, F < 1. The text-reading
   skills, measured with the AVI reading cards (Krom et al., 2010) were
   comparable to those of an average pupil after 30 to 31 months of
   reading education.

Materials

   To determine the word reading skills of the participants, the Three
   Minute Test [Drie Minuten Toets, DMT] (Krom et al., 2010) was used.
   This is a time-limited test consisting of three cards with words of
   different levels. The first card (i.e., Card 1) contains CV, VC, CVC
   words. The second card (i.e., Card 2) contains CCV, CCVC, CVCC, CCVCC,
   CCCVC, and CVCCC words. The third card (i.e., Card 3) contains
   multisyllabic words. The participants were asked to read aloud the
   words as fast and as accurately as possible. The number of words read
   correctly within 1 min determines the score. Reliability and validity
   are considered to be good (Egberink, Janssen, & Vermeulen, 2014b).
   There are three comparable versions available (i.e., versions A, B, and
   C). Each version contains the same words, but the words are presented
   in a different order. The fact that the versions are not identical may
   reduce or even nullify the repetition effect.

   Although the versions are assumed to be comparable, all versions were
   converted in the three different fonts, to prevent inferences by the
   version of the test. In order to correct for the extra
   interline-spacing and larger letters in the font Dyslexie, adjustments
   were made to the interline spacing and body size. We tried to match for
   x-height. Therefore, for Cards 1 and 2, we used Arial point size 16
   (capital height 4.04 mm, x-height 2.93 mm), Times New Roman in point
   size 16 (capital height 3.75 mm, x-height 2.53 mm), both with interline
   space 1.15, and Dyslexie in point size 13 (capital height 4.28 mm,
   x-height 2.72 mm) with interline space 0.85. For Card 3, we used Arial
   point size 14 (capital height 3.54 mm, x-height 2.57 mm), Times New
   Roman in point size 14 (capital height 3.28 mm, x-height 2.21 mm), both
   with vertical line spacing 1.30 and Dyslexie in point size 11 (capital
   height 3.62 mm, x-height 2.30 mm) with 1.0 vertical line spacing.

Procedure

   Participants were tested at three different measurements (i.e., Times
   1, 2, and 3) and read the cards in all three fonts. The time interval
   between sessions was one to 2 weeks. In Table 4 the design used in
   Experiment 2 is displayed. At Time 1, version A of the cards was
   applied, at Time 2 version B, and at Time 3 version C. After card
   reading at Time 3, participants were also asked whether they had a
   preference for one of the three fonts.

   Apart from the significant effect of the covariate, F(1, 140) = 113.4,
   p < .0001, η ^2 = .45, there was a significant main effect of Group, F
   (1, 140) = 44.2, p < .0001, η ^2 = .24. Children without dyslexia had
   faster reading times than children with dyslexia on all three cards.
   The main effect of Card was also significant, F(2, 280) = 27.5,
   p < .0001, η ^2 = .16. Post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparisons
   revealed that scores on Cards 1 were significantly higher than on Cards
   2, which in turn were significantly higher than on Cards 3 (all
   p’s < .0001), which confirms the fact that orthographically complex
   words are more difficult to read than orthographically simple words
   (Card 1 is the easiest and 3 the most difficult). Neither the main
   effect of Font order nor the interaction between Font order and any of
   the other variables reached significant levels, indicating no
   differences with respect to ease of reading between the different
   fonts. To substantiate our finding, we present all Univariate GLM’s
   with age as covariate for each Card at each moment of time. Findings in
   Table 5 clearly show that fonts were equally easy (or difficult for
   that matter) to read.

Font preference

   A preference for Arial was shown by 38.1% of the participants, 29.9%
   preferred Times New Roman, and 11.6% chose the font Dyslexie. The
   remaining 19.7% did not have a preference. A one-sample chi-squared
   test showed that fewer participants showed a preference for the font
   Dyslexie than expected, fewer participants showed no preference than
   expected, but more participants preferred Arial than expected and more
   participants preferred Times New Roman than expected (χ^2 (3) = 23.92,
   p < .0001). The distribution of the preferences, however, was
   significantly different for children with and children without dyslexia
   (χ^2 (3) = 10.54, p < .015). Of the children with dyslexia, 45.1%
   preferred Arial, 29.4% Times New Roman, and 10.8% Dyslexie. The
   remaining 13.7% had no preference. Of the children without dyslexia,
   22.2% preferred Arial, 31.1% Times New Roman, and 13.3% Dyslexie. The
   remaining 33.3% had no preference.

Reading performance and font preference

   To test for the effect of preference on reading performance, a 2
   (Group: children with dyslexia vs. children without dyslexia) by 4
   (Preference: Dyslexie vs. Arial vs. Times New Roman vs. None) × 3
   (Font: Dyslexie vs. Arial vs. Times New Roman) GLM repeated measures
   ANOVA was conducted on the total number of words read correctly on the
   sum score of all three Cards. Font served as within-subjects variable,
   preference as a between-subjects variable, and age served as covariate.
   Apart from the significant effects of the covariate, F(1,
   137) = 108.84, p < .0001, η ^2 = .44, and the significant effect of
   Group, F(1, 137) = 28.10, p < .0001, η ^2 = .17, none of the other
   effects reached significance: main effects of Font, F(2, 274 = 1.22,
   p = .30, η ^2 = .009, and Preference, F(3, 137) = 1.15, p = .33, η
   ^2 = .025. The non-significant interaction between Font and Preference,
   F(6, 274) = 1.10, p = .36, η ^2 = .023, indicated no relationship
   between preference and number of words read correctly. Mean scores are
   presented in Table 6.

   *The information on preference for one child with dyslexia was lost;
   analysis was therefore based on 146 children rather than 147

Conclusion

   Despite the fact that the children without dyslexia were more than
   1 year younger than children with dyslexia, they proved to be the
   better reader. This emphasizes the fact that the group of children who
   were diagnosed with dyslexia are indeed poor readers. Participants with
   and without dyslexia read as many words correctly during 1 min in the
   font Dyslexie as they did in Arial and Times New Roman. Neither of the
   groups showed a preference for the font Dyslexie; in fact more
   participants preferred Arial and Times New Roman above Dyslexie.
   Moreover, preference was not related to number of words read correctly.
   Finally, no effect of repeated reading occurred, which corroborates our
   assumption that the different order of words on the cards causes the
   cards to be similar but not identical.

General discussion

   This study was conducted to test whether the font Dyslexie could be
   beneficial for readers with dyslexia. Our first question concerned the
   effect of font on reading performances. Reading performance of children
   with and without dyslexia at word and text level are not better when
   they read in the font Dyslexie compared to the fonts Arial and Times
   New Roman. Although no effect on reading performance was found, it was
   possible that children with dyslexia displayed a preference for the
   font developed for children with dyslexia. Therefore, our second
   research question examined the preferences of children with and without
   dyslexia for a particular font. At text level, children with dyslexia
   preferred the font Arial over Dyslexie. The font Dyslexie was favored
   the least by children with and without dyslexia at the word level. The
   third research question was whether reading texts or words in the
   preferred font, would lead to better reading outcomes. We found no
   effect of reading a text or words in the preferred font on reading
   performances for dyslexic children or for children without dyslexia.

   The results of both our experiments do not support the claim that the
   font Dyslexie facilitates the reading of dyslexic people. These
   findings are mostly in line with other Dutch studies conducted by de
   Leeuw (2010) and Pijpker (2013). First, de Leeuw (2010) found no
   effects of font on reading speed. However, these conclusions concerning
   reading speed were based on the effects of raw scores, that is, the
   number of words read correctly in 1 min. Normally the raw score is the
   number of words read in 1 min, irrespective of whether the words are
   read correctly or not. The “raw scores” in this study not only
   represent the reading speed, but also the accuracy of reading. Thus, in
   line with our results, de Leeuw found no effect of font on the number
   of words read correctly. Second, her conclusion that dyslectic students
   made fewer errors in the Dyslexie font version of the word-reading task
   (M = 1.3, SD = 1.4) than in the Arial font version (M = 1.7, SD = 1.3)
   could not be verified, because no proper statistical proof was
   presented. Finally, for pseudoword reading no effects were found
   either. Also in line with our findings are the results of Pijpker
   (2013), who found no effect at text level. The only effect in her study
   emerged when the group of dyslectic readers were divided into
   relatively good and poor readers. Note, that she did not make clear how
   this distinction was made. Thus, empirical evidence for Boer’s claim
   that the font Dyslexie has positive effects on the reading performances
   of people with dyslexia is lacking. His claim was based on just this
   one effect.

   At this point, we need to discuss the fact that a major part of our
   standpoint is based on an abundance of null-findings, statistically a
   not very convincing argument. Note, however, that the experiments
   revealed three significant findings in line with previous research.
   First, in both experiments, a highly significant effect of age (the
   covariate) emerged; older children performed consistently better than
   younger children (e.g., Verhoeven & van Leeuwe, 2003). Second,
   Experiment 1 revealed a robust repetition effect as a result of
   repeated reading of identical materials, which converges with results
   from numerous studies on word and text reading (see for a
   meta-analysis, Thierren, 2004). Third, Experiment 2 revealed that
   reading single, isolated words in children with dyslexia was
   significantly worse than that of children without dyslexia. With
   respect to all null-findings related to the effect of font on reading
   performance, we would like to put forward that the majority of the
   statistical analyses revealed F-values smaller than 1, values that are
   not even approaching significance.

   Both experiments showed that the font Dyslexie was not preferred by the
   children with dyslexia or by the children with normal reading
   development. These findings are in contradiction with the findings by
   de Leeuw (2010). She claimed that participants with dyslexia have a
   more positive attitude towards the font Dyslexie than typical reading
   students, based on the percentages of the answers given by the students
   with dyslexia and without dyslexia (i.e., on the four categories
   “unpleasant”, “neutral”, “pleasant”, and “very pleasant”) and reported
   no statistical analyses to underpin this conclusion. Furthermore, these
   differences in findings between the results of de Leeuw (2010) and the
   present study could be explained by a difference in procedure that has
   been followed. In de Leeuw’s research, participants were asked whether
   they preferred the font that was especially designed for people with
   dyslexia. In our research, the participants were not informed about the
   names of the fonts. The more positive attitude towards the font
   Dyslexie in de Leeuw’s research might be affected by her procedure. For
   people with dyslexia, the message that a simple solution like the use
   of a special font might lead to better reading outcomes can be rather
   hopeful. On top of that, de Leeuw (2010) presented only a selection of
   the results of the questionnaire measuring font preference in her
   thesis. In the appendix of her master thesis she reported all five
   questions asking the students how they experienced the font Dyslexie
   but again, no statistical analyses were given. When the students with
   dyslexia and the students with a normal reading development were asked
   whether they would use the font Dyslexie, no groups’ differences could
   be revealed (de Leeuw, 2010).

   All in all, the font Dyslexie, developed to facilitate the reading of
   dyslexic people, does not have the desired effect. Children with
   dyslexia do not read better when text is printed in the font Dyslexie
   than when text is printed in Arial or Times New Roman. One of the
   claims of the designer of the font Dyslexie (Boer, 2015), was that it
   facilitates reading because of the difference between the letters.
   According to Boer (2015), letters in the font Dyslexie are more
   distinct from each other than letters in other fonts. Marinus et al.
   (2016), however, have shown that, compared to the font Arial, the
   letters of the font Dyslexie are less distinct from one another. The
   statement that the relative x-height of the font Dyslexie is larger
   compared to other fonts, is not correct either (Gianotten, 2014a,
   2015). This might explain the finding that dyslexic children did not
   read faster or more accurate when reading in the font Dyslexie than in
   Arial.

   Contrary to our findings, Marinus et al. (2016) did find that children
   with reading problems read English texts significantly faster in font
   Dyslexie than in Arial. However, they concluded that these results
   could not explained by the shape of the letters, but the broader
   spacing settings. In our experiments, we controlled for vertical
   spacing, but not for horizontal spacing. It would have been interesting
   if we had added this variable to examine the effects of spacing in
   words and texts on the reading performances on young children with
   dyslexia. Furthermore, we tried to control for the adaptations Boer
   made to the body size of the font by comparing the font Dyslexie with a
   smaller point size than the fonts Arial and Times New Roman; note that,
   these measurements do not exactly match. We do not believe that this
   has affected the results, because differences in x-height only emerge
   when the differences in x-heights are substantial (Bernard et al.,
   2002). As explained in the introduction, it is not possible to control
   for all variables at the same time.

   In sum, the adaptations made to create the font Dyslexie have been
   disputed and the empirical findings also challenge the claim that
   Dyslexie is a better font for dyslectics. We haste to add that Dyslexie
   does not affect reading negatively. If children prefer to read texts in
   Dyslexie, there is no reason to discourage this. However, Wery and
   Diliberto (2016) warn for other negative effects using a font that
   claims to make reading easier. Readers who already have experienced
   major disappointments in learning to read may find it distressing when
   they fail to encounter positive effects of font characteristics. Also,
   purchasing the Dyslexie font and transferring materials into this font
   could also shift the focus (time and money) from interventions that
   have been proven effective (Wery & Diliberto, 2016). Therefore, we
   advise to focus on effective interventions for better reading outcomes.
   An effective intervention to improve reading in both accuracy and
   fluency contains (1) an expanded instruction in reading and (2) an
   increase of the number of words and text read (Bosman & Gijsel, 2007).
   To encourage reading, we believe that children should take advantage of
   the free available technical opportunities to adjust font type, font
   size and spacing options in digital texts to their personal preference.
   The purchase of a special font for dyslectics will then probably be
   unnecessary. Future research should focus on adjustments to texts that
   could be done easily by changing the settings in computers, laptops,
   tablets and e-readers to facilitate reading. A collaboration between
   the field of researchers in typography and psychology is recommended.
