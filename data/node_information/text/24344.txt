The sign of trust for
certified shops

   Online shops are checked for compliance with the Trusted Shops quality
   criteria before they are awarded the trustmark that they can then
   display on their website. Our quality criteria involve strict
   requirements as to the service quality as well as legal requirements.

   The security resulting from the trustmark, authentic customer reviews,
   and the money-back guarantee offered by the European leading trust
   brand is indeed very much appreciated by customers across the globe.

Buyer protection for
carefree shopping

   Online shopping is fast, convenient, and anonymous. This anonymity also
   entails a lack of security: who am I actually buying from? What do I
   get in exchange for my money?

   That’s where we come into play: to make trust and security tangible for
   online shoppers like you. We offer the money-back guarantee covering
   orders of up to 2,500 EUR from all online shops bearing our trustmark.

Authentic reviews by
real customers

   Have the indicated delivery times been fulfilled? How does the customer
   service deal with problems? Does the product correspond to the
   description?

   You can find reliable answers to all these questions in the reviews
   posted by other customers like you. But shop and product reviews are
   only helpful if they are really authentic. That’s what the Trusted
   Shops review system is there for: for you to be able to rely on
   authentic reviews by real customers.
