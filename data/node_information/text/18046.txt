     * LineageOS 15.1 - Android 8.1 Oreo
     * Based on the Nvidia Shield TV trees
     * TWRP pre-installed
     * CPU and GPU performance profiles
     * Works in handheld and docked mode
     * Audio is supported
     * Joycons connect via Bluetooth, also in handheld mode
     * Reboot to Payload (NEW!). Rebooting will reboot to android and
       reboot to boodloader will boot hekate.

   Known bugs:
     * Deep sleep, so battery life is not great
     * Auto rotation as we haven't figured out how to talk to the sensor
       yet
     * Screen off in dock
     * Charging is not detected, but console still charges
     * Some apps don't handle joycon inputs correctly
     * The touchscreen sometimes detects touches even when your finger is
       just floating over the screen
     * There is a system process ANR on boot. Just click „Wait“ and it
       won’t happen again until next boot
     * Screenshots do not work
     * WiFi may randomly stop working. If this happens just reboot
     * If TV looks odd and grainy when docking then redock a few times.
     * No TV keyboard that can be used with gamepad
     * SELinux is disabled
     * You can’t access the FAT32 partition of the SD card on macOS.
       Windows and Linux works.
     * You tell us ;)

   Installation instructions
   Quote:

    1. Pick the image that corresponds to the size of your SD card. You
       can use an image that is smaller than your card. You’ll end up with
       the remaining space unused on your card.
    2. Write the image to your SD card with e.g. balenaEtcher Do not
       extract the image, Etcher can handle the compressed image just
       fine! WARNING: This will overwrite any contents on your card! The
       progress bar/percentage might go haywire in Etcher, but you can
       ignore that. The flashing will still work and Etcher will let you
       know when it’s done. It can take up to an hour depending on your SD
       card’s speed. Also make sure not to format any of the partitions
       when Windows prompts you to after flashing.
    3. Download GApps for Android 8.1. from OpenGApps, use ARM64. Put the
       file on the first partition of your new SD card
    4. If desired download the "Shield-ifier" zip and place it also on the
       SD card. This will make your Switch identify as Nvidia Shield TV
       and install the Nvidia app.
    5. Load hekate and boot to TWRP by holding VOL+ when you select the
       Android config.
    6. Make sure to mount /system first in TWRP. Flash GApps zip,
       reboot2payload zip and optionally flash other zips. Also after
       installing GApps wipe cache/dalvik as offered by TWRP. Video that
       shows how to access and flash zips in TWRP:
       https://youtu.be/3F6WgAb44yk
    7. Reboot to hekate and boot into Android
    8. Complete the inital setup. For the Nvidia app to work make sure to
       update it from Play Store!

   FAQ
   Quote:

   Q: How to switch performance profiles?
   A: Go to Settings -> Battery -> Power Profiles. The options are
   Balanced = 1 GHz CPU / 468 MHz GPU, Quick = 1.4 GHz CPU / 768 MHz GPU
   and Performance = 1.7 GHz CPU / 920 MHz GPU. Keep in mind that the high
   performance profiles use MUCH more battery.
   Q: How will updates be done?
   A: For updates, flashable zips will be released.
   Q: Can we use TV mode?
   A: Use HAL launcher from the Play Store to run apps in TV mode.
   Q: Nvidia GameStream doesn’t perform well, what to do?
   A: Try using Moonlight instead.
   Q: Does Magisk work?
   A: Yes, just flash it in TWRP
   Q: I get an error about „invalid architecture“ when trying to flash
   GApps
   A: Make sure you mounted System in TWRP
   Q: Does this work on any Switch?
   A: You will need to be able to boot into hekate. If you can do that,
   your Switch is compatible.

   What do the different sized versions do? What happens if I have a 128gb
   micro sd card and then choose the 64gb image? Does this create a
   partition automatically for the android stuff and the rest is usable as
   normal?

   We’re working on the server issues. Please some patience
   Also the SD card sizes has to be _at least_ the image size you
   download. Any larger card will just have unallocated space in the end
   of (sd_size - image_size).

   Features
   Quote:

     * LineageOS 15.1 - Android 8.1 Oreo
     * Based on the Nvidia Shield TV trees
     * TWRP pre-installed
     * CPU and GPU performance profiles
     * Works in handheld and docked mode
     * Audio is supported
     * Joycons connect via Bluetooth, also in handheld mode
     * Reboot to Payload (NEW!). Rebooting will reboot to android and
       reboot to boodloader will boot hekate.

   Known bugs:
     * Deep sleep, so battery life is not great
     * Auto rotation as we haven't figured out how to talk to the sensor
       yet
     * Screen off in dock
     * Charging is not detected, but console still charges
     * Some apps don't handle joycon inputs correctly
     * The touchscreen sometimes detects touches even when your finger is
       just floating over the screen
     * There is a system process ANR on boot. Just click „Wait“ and it
       won’t happen again until next boot
     * Screenshots do not work
     * WiFi may randomly stop working. If this happens just reboot
     * If TV looks odd and grainy when docking then redock a few times.
     * No TV keyboard that can be used with gamepad
     * SELinux is disabled
     * You can’t access the FAT32 partition of the SD card on macOS.
       Windows and Linux works.
     * You tell us ;)

   Installation instructions
   Quote:

    1. Pick the image that corresponds to the size of your SD card. You
       can use an image that is smaller than your card. You’ll end up with
       the remaining space unused on your card.
    2. Write the image to your SD card with e.g. balenaEtcher Do not
       extract the image, Etcher can handle the compressed image just
       fine! WARNING: This will overwrite any contents on your card! The
       progress bar/percentage might go haywire in Etcher, but you can
       ignore that. The flashing will still work and Etcher will let you
       know when it’s done. It can take up to an hour depending on your SD
       card’s speed. Also make sure not to format any of the partitions
       when Windows prompts you to after flashing.
    3. Download GApps for Android 8.1. from OpenGApps, use ARM64. Put the
       file on the first partition of your new SD card
    4. If desired download the "Shield-ifier" zip and place it also on the
       SD card. This will make your Switch identify as Nvidia Shield TV
       and install the Nvidia app.
    5. Load hekate and boot to TWRP by holding VOL+ when you select the
       Android config.
    6. Make sure to mount /system first in TWRP. Flash GApps zip,
       reboot2payload zip and optionally flash other zips. Also after
       installing GApps wipe cache/dalvik as offered by TWRP. Video that
       shows how to access and flash zips in TWRP:
       https://youtu.be/3F6WgAb44yk
    7. Reboot to hekate and boot into Android
    8. Complete the inital setup. For the Nvidia app to work make sure to
       update it from Play Store!

   FAQ
   Quote:

   Q: How to switch performance profiles?
   A: Go to Settings -> Battery -> Power Profiles. The options are
   Balanced = 1 GHz CPU / 468 MHz GPU, Quick = 1.4 GHz CPU / 768 MHz GPU
   and Performance = 1.7 GHz CPU / 920 MHz GPU. Keep in mind that the high
   performance profiles use MUCH more battery.
   Q: How will updates be done?
   A: For updates, flashable zips will be released.
   Q: Can we use TV mode?
   A: Use HAL launcher from the Play Store to run apps in TV mode.
   Q: Nvidia GameStream doesn’t perform well, what to do?
   A: Try using Moonlight instead.
   Q: Does Magisk work?
   A: Yes, just flash it in TWRP
   Q: I get an error about „invalid architecture“ when trying to flash
   GApps
   A: Make sure you mounted System in TWRP
   Q: Does this work on any Switch?
   A: You will need to be able to boot into hekate. If you can do that,
   your Switch is compatible.

   What do the different sized versions do? What happens if I have a 128gb
   micro sd card and then choose the 64gb image? Does this create a
   partition automatically for the android stuff and the rest is usable as
   normal?

   We’re working on the server issues. Please some patience
   Also the SD card sizes has to be _at least_ the image size you
   download. Any larger card will just have unallocated space in the end
   of (sd_size - image_size).

   Is it possible to get a torrent going that contains all versions (since
   you can select which files you want in most clients)? I wouldn't mind
   help seeding it for a while.
   Also, MD5/SHA hashes for the files would be great, both for checking
   download integrity as well as making sure any mirrored files are
   genuine.

   I have added the sha1sums to the second post. Official torrents will
