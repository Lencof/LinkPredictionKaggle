Borderlands 3 Is 2K's Fastest Selling Game Ever

   see deal
   Borderlands 3 - Xbox One
   $59.99on Amazon
   publisher 2K says the looter shooter sold over five million copies
   during its first five days on the market, making it the fastest-selling
   game in the company's history.

   That works out at 50 percent more sales than Borderlands 2 during the
   same launch window - a game which went on to sell over 22 million
   units.
   The high figures were achieved despite backlash from fans when it was
   announced the PC version of Borderlands 3 would be an Epic Games
   exclusive. A press release from 2K announcing the sales records draws
   attention to the store figures in particular, saying "Borderlands 3
   delivered the highest pre-order sales figures to date for a 2K title,
   as well as broke pre-order records with the Epic Games Store. Initial
   sales of Borderlands 3 have exceeded the label’s expectations and, in
   particular, PC sales of the title through the Epic Games Store have
   been incredibly strong."
   Over 70 percent of Borderlands 3's sales were digital, and the game has
   consistently pulled views over on Twitch. 2K says it's generated more
   than 14 million hours of content on the streaming platform, which is
   more than half the viewership that Borderlands 2 generated over seven
   years.
   Our review said Borderlands 3 was the best in a series of great co-op
   shooters. Our full thoughts are in the video above.
   Despite copies flying off virtual shelves, the first few days of
   Borderlands 3 involved some teething problems. Players on PC reported
   problems with cloud saves, while split-screen play had some performance
   issues.

PlayStation 5 Will Include Power Saving Feature to Tackle Climate Change

The ultimate boss battle.

   By IGN Staff
   Posted: 23 Sep 2019 9:42 am

   The PlayStation 5 will have an optional setting to slash the amount of
   power the next-generation console consumes in standby mode.

   In a blog post, Sony announced it's working with the United Nations as
   part of its "Playing For The Planet" initiative, which aims to mobilise
   gamers to take an active role in combating climate change. Part of this
   effort involves partnered companies like PlayStation examining ways
   they can reduce their carbon footprint, and Sony is committing to
   working sustainable features into its new console's design.
   "The next generation PlayStation console will include the possibility
   to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4 (which
   we estimate can be achieved at around 0.5 W),” writes Jim Ryan,
   President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “If just one
   million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the
   average electricity use of 1,000 US homes.”
   Environmental safeguarding is ace, and in the video above we list more
   PS5 features we really want.
   Compared to other forms of technology, gaming is notorious for its
   carbon footprint. A recent report found that American gamers emit
   around 12 million tons of carbon dioxide annually - the equivalent of
   2.3 million cars. PlayStation has been working to reduce the
   environmental impact of the PS4 for the past few years by introducing
   energy saving modes and tweaking its hardware.
   "For context, we estimate the carbon emissions we have avoided to date
   already amount to almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29
   million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals
   the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017)," Ryan claimed.
   The PS4 has sold over 100 million units worldwide, so if the next
   member of Sony's console family sells anywhere near as much, power
   saving features could have a huge impact - but only if players care
   about it. Since the setting is optional, those who purchase a PS5 will
   have to activate it themselves.

   "The gaming community is diverse and growing at a fast pace," Ryan
   wrote. "There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games
   industry to take a stand and support the UN Environment team by
   communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for
   generations to come."
   Tomorrow is Sony's State of Play presentation, and we've rounded up
   everything we expect to see. In the meantime, back in May PS5's lead
   system architect detailed some of the components the team's already put
   in the console.

Box Office: Downton Abbey Trounces Rambo: Last Blood and Ad Astra

Brad Pitt and Sylvester Stallone get served.

   The posh upstairs/downstairs antics of Downton Abbey: The Movie - the
   cinematic sequel to Julian Fellowes' hit TV series - was enough of a
   dapper draw to rake in an estimated $31 million in its opening weekend.
   It's a handsome haul that proved too much to overcome for Sylvester
   Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood and Brad Pitt's sci-fi flick, Ad Astra.

   Adding in the overseas box office, Downton Abbey's pulled in $30.8
   million, bringing its entire run so far to $61.8 million. Which is the
   type of take vs. budget (a meager $13 million) that might have Focus
   Features and Universal Pictures International working feverishly to
   craft a sequel.
   Last Blood and Ad Astra didn't perform poorly however, with Pitt's
   well-reviewed space mystery snagging second place with $19.2 million.
   It was enough to just barely edge out Stallone's final installment in
   the 37-year Rambo franchise, which made $19 million.
   IGN's reviews of the films reported that Rambo: Last Blood encapsulated
   everything wrong with the franchise and that Ad Astra was an
   eye-popping spectacle too bleak to truly connect with.
   Meanwhile, Downton Abbey was filled with enough memorable performances
   to possibly make it an Oscar contender.

North American Box Office Estimates

   Rounding out the Top 5 are It: Chapter Two, which earned $17.2 million
   in its fourth weekend and wound up passing the $200 million mark
   internationally, and Hustlers, which brought in $17 million.
   Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also wound up passing
   the $200 million mark internationally this weekend.
   Here are the weekend's Top 10 North American box office estimates (via
   Box Office Mojo)
     * 1. Downton Abbey $31,000,000
     * 2. Ad Astra $19,210,000
     * 3. Rambo: Last Blood $19,015,000
     * 4. IT: Chapter Two $17,245,000
     * 5. Hustlers $17,000,000
     * 6. The Lion King $2,572,000
     * 7. Good Boys $2,510,000
     * 8. Angel Has Fallen $2,400,000
     * 9. Overcomer $1,500,000
     * 10. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw $1,460,000

Death Stranding Gameplay: Kojima Gives a Tour of Sam's Private Room (Now in
English)

Customize gear, play music, plan your adventure, and so much more.

   At Tokyo Game Show 2019, Hideo Kojima showed off and discussed nearly
   35 minutes of Death Stranding
   see deal
   Death Stranding - PlayStation 4
   $59.99on Amazon
   gameplay that focused on Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges' private
   room, where Sam can customize his gear, play music, display figures,
   and even have nightmares. IGN has fully translated Kojima's gameplay
   commentary, which was previously only available in Japanese.

   Watch the video above to see the full gameplay demonstration, now with
   English subtitles.
   Last week, we broke down this demo that also reveals that if the camera
   lingers too much on Sam's crotch, he will punch said camera.
   This follows another 49-minute Death Stranding demo with Kojima
   commentary that IGN has also translated that focuses more on the
   open-world gameplay and giving fans an in-depth look of this much
   anticipated game in action. You can see the full video below!
   You can check out everything we learned about Death Stranding's
   gameplay from this TGS 2019 stream, as well as 105 details about Death
   Stranding that you might have missed.
   If that isn't enough, we've gathered every Death Stranding trailer and
   cinematic so far in one place to ensure you are up-to-date on
   everything revealed so far for the PlayStation 4 exclusive that will be
   released on November 8, 2019.

   Kojima has recently opened up a lot more about Death Stranding and
   explained how it is a metaphor for modern day society and that he
   believes more Death Stranding games are needed for his idea of a
   "Strand" genre to catch on.
   Death Standing stars Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and he is a delivery
   man of sorts that must help reunite the United States by connecting
   cities through the Chiral Network.
   Get straight to the action moments of the latest Death Stranding
   gameplay demo with the below video!

Borderlands 3 Is 2K's Fastest Selling Game Ever

Kaching.

   Alysia Judge

   Updated: 23 Sep 2019 11:30 pm
   Posted: 23 Sep 2019 1:50 pm

   Borderlands 3's
   see deal
   Borderlands 3 - Xbox One
   $59.99on Amazon
   publisher 2K says the looter shooter sold over five million copies
   during its first five days on the market, making it the fastest-selling
   game in the company's history.

   That works out at 50 percent more sales than Borderlands 2 during the
   same launch window - a game which went on to sell over 22 million
   units.
   The high figures were achieved despite backlash from fans when it was
   announced the PC version of Borderlands 3 would be an Epic Games
   exclusive. A press release from 2K announcing the sales records draws
   attention to the store figures in particular, saying "Borderlands 3
   delivered the highest pre-order sales figures to date for a 2K title,
   as well as broke pre-order records with the Epic Games Store. Initial
   sales of Borderlands 3 have exceeded the label’s expectations and, in
   particular, PC sales of the title through the Epic Games Store have
   been incredibly strong."
   Over 70 percent of Borderlands 3's sales were digital, and the game has
   consistently pulled views over on Twitch. 2K says it's generated more
   than 14 million hours of content on the streaming platform, which is
   more than half the viewership that Borderlands 2 generated over seven
   years.
   Our review said Borderlands 3 was the best in a series of great co-op
   shooters. Our full thoughts are in the video above.
   Despite copies flying off virtual shelves, the first few days of
   Borderlands 3 involved some teething problems. Players on PC reported
   problems with cloud saves, while split-screen play had some performance
   issues.

PlayStation 5 Will Include Power Saving Feature to Tackle Climate Change

The ultimate boss battle.

   By IGN Staff
   Posted: 23 Sep 2019 9:42 am

   The PlayStation 5 will have an optional setting to slash the amount of
   power the next-generation console consumes in standby mode.

   In a blog post, Sony announced it's working with the United Nations as
   part of its "Playing For The Planet" initiative, which aims to mobilise
   gamers to take an active role in combating climate change. Part of this
   effort involves partnered companies like PlayStation examining ways
   they can reduce their carbon footprint, and Sony is committing to
   working sustainable features into its new console's design.
   "The next generation PlayStation console will include the possibility
   to suspend gameplay with much lower power consumption than PS4 (which
   we estimate can be achieved at around 0.5 W),” writes Jim Ryan,
   President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. “If just one
   million users enable this feature, it would save equivalent to the
   average electricity use of 1,000 US homes.”
   Environmental safeguarding is ace, and in the video above we list more
   PS5 features we really want.
   Compared to other forms of technology, gaming is notorious for its
   carbon footprint. A recent report found that American gamers emit
   around 12 million tons of carbon dioxide annually - the equivalent of
   2.3 million cars. PlayStation has been working to reduce the
   environmental impact of the PS4 for the past few years by introducing
   energy saving modes and tweaking its hardware.
   "For context, we estimate the carbon emissions we have avoided to date
   already amount to almost 16 million metric tons, increasing to 29
   million metric tons over the course of the next 10 years (which equals
   the CO2 emissions for the nation of Denmark in 2017)," Ryan claimed.
   The PS4 has sold over 100 million units worldwide, so if the next
   member of Sony's console family sells anywhere near as much, power
   saving features could have a huge impact - but only if players care
   about it. Since the setting is optional, those who purchase a PS5 will
   have to activate it themselves.

   "The gaming community is diverse and growing at a fast pace," Ryan
   wrote. "There is an undeniable opportunity for leaders in the games
   industry to take a stand and support the UN Environment team by
   communicating the importance of preserving natural resources for
   generations to come."
   Tomorrow is Sony's State of Play presentation, and we've rounded up
   everything we expect to see. In the meantime, back in May PS5's lead
   system architect detailed some of the components the team's already put
   in the console.

Box Office: Downton Abbey Trounces Rambo: Last Blood and Ad Astra

Brad Pitt and Sylvester Stallone get served.

   The posh upstairs/downstairs antics of Downton Abbey: The Movie - the
   cinematic sequel to Julian Fellowes' hit TV series - was enough of a
   dapper draw to rake in an estimated $31 million in its opening weekend.
   It's a handsome haul that proved too much to overcome for Sylvester
   Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood and Brad Pitt's sci-fi flick, Ad Astra.

   Adding in the overseas box office, Downton Abbey's pulled in $30.8
   million, bringing its entire run so far to $61.8 million. Which is the
   type of take vs. budget (a meager $13 million) that might have Focus
   Features and Universal Pictures International working feverishly to
   craft a sequel.
   Last Blood and Ad Astra didn't perform poorly however, with Pitt's
   well-reviewed space mystery snagging second place with $19.2 million.
   It was enough to just barely edge out Stallone's final installment in
   the 37-year Rambo franchise, which made $19 million.
   IGN's reviews of the films reported that Rambo: Last Blood encapsulated
   everything wrong with the franchise and that Ad Astra was an
   eye-popping spectacle too bleak to truly connect with.
   Meanwhile, Downton Abbey was filled with enough memorable performances
   to possibly make it an Oscar contender.

North American Box Office Estimates

   Rounding out the Top 5 are It: Chapter Two, which earned $17.2 million
   in its fourth weekend and wound up passing the $200 million mark
   internationally, and Hustlers, which brought in $17 million.
   Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also wound up passing
   the $200 million mark internationally this weekend.
   Here are the weekend's Top 10 North American box office estimates (via
   Box Office Mojo)
     * 1. Downton Abbey $31,000,000
     * 2. Ad Astra $19,210,000
     * 3. Rambo: Last Blood $19,015,000
     * 4. IT: Chapter Two $17,245,000
     * 5. Hustlers $17,000,000
     * 6. The Lion King $2,572,000
     * 7. Good Boys $2,510,000
     * 8. Angel Has Fallen $2,400,000
     * 9. Overcomer $1,500,000
     * 10. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw $1,460,000

   ceremony, dominating below-the-line categories including casting,
   costumes, main title design, makeup, score, editing, sound editing,
   sound mixing, special visual effects, and stunt coordination.
   Earlier in the night, Peter Dinklage won the Emmy for best supporting
   actor for his role as Tyrion Lannister, beating his castmates Nikolaj
   Coster-Waldau and Alfie Allen in the category. Supporting actress went
   to Ozark's Julia Garner, who beat GOT's Gwendoline Christie, Lena
   Headey, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, and Killing Eve's Fiona Shaw.
   Kit Harington lost out in the Lead Actor category to Pose's Billy
   Porter, while Emilia Clarke lost out on Lead Actress to Killing Eve's

Death Stranding Gameplay: Kojima Gives a Tour of Sam's Private Room (Now in
English)

Customize gear, play music, plan your adventure, and so much more.

   At Tokyo Game Show 2019, Hideo Kojima showed off and discussed nearly
   35 minutes of Death Stranding
   see deal
   Death Stranding - PlayStation 4
   $59.99on Amazon
   gameplay that focused on Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges' private
   room, where Sam can customize his gear, play music, display figures,
   and even have nightmares. IGN has fully translated Kojima's gameplay
   commentary, which was previously only available in Japanese.

   Watch the video above to see the full gameplay demonstration, now with
   English subtitles.
   Last week, we broke down this demo that also reveals that if the camera
   lingers too much on Sam's crotch, he will punch said camera.
   This follows another 49-minute Death Stranding demo with Kojima
   commentary that IGN has also translated that focuses more on the
   open-world gameplay and giving fans an in-depth look of this much
   anticipated game in action. You can see the full video below!
   You can check out everything we learned about Death Stranding's
   gameplay from this TGS 2019 stream, as well as 105 details about Death
   Stranding that you might have missed.
   If that isn't enough, we've gathered every Death Stranding trailer and
   cinematic so far in one place to ensure you are up-to-date on
   everything revealed so far for the PlayStation 4 exclusive that will be
   released on November 8, 2019.

   Kojima has recently opened up a lot more about Death Stranding and
   explained how it is a metaphor for modern day society and that he
   believes more Death Stranding games are needed for his idea of a
   "Strand" genre to catch on.
   Death Standing stars Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges and he is a delivery
   man of sorts that must help reunite the United States by connecting
   cities through the Chiral Network.
   Get straight to the action moments of the latest Death Stranding
   gameplay demo with the below video!
