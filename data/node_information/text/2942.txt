Minecraft Is Getting a Character Creator

   Minecraft
   $6.99on Amazon
   is introducing an in-game character creator that lets players customize
   their avatar's hairstyle, skin colour, and body shape.

   As announced in the Minecraft Beta's 1.13.0.15 patch notes, there'll be
   over 100 free customization items alongside extra accessories created
   by the development team available for purchase.

   The creator appears to be fairly detailed, with the notes promising
   options to design "body size and shape, limb replacement and tweaking
   of eyes, mouth, hairstyles and colours, facial hair and skin tones."
   Previously, custom skins created outside the game and imported in were
   the only way to personalise your avatar. That approach is still allowed
   in a "Classic Skins Tab" where players can upload them in the same way
   they did before.
   Check out Minecraft's enhanced lighting effects in the video above.
   Character creation will eventually roll out to Minecraft Earth, iOS,
   and Nintendo Switch, but for now it's only available in the Beta on
   Xbox One, Windows 10, and Android.
   Last month we got our first look at ray tracing in Minecraft, which is
   a rendering technique capable of creating incredibly realistic lighting
   effects. For Minecraft, that means reflections, god rays, and shadows
   across its blocky world.

BioWare Abandons Current Anthem Post-Launch Plans

Walking before running.

   Plans for more post-launch content in Anthem
   see deal
   Anthem - PlayStation 4
   $17.49on Amazon
   have been put on ice so the development team can focus on updates and
   thoroughly review core issues surrounding gameplay.

   Bioware's head of live service, Chad Robertson, announced the decision
   in a blog post that detailed some of the changes the development team
   had made to Anthem following player feedback. These include combat
   balancing, more reward crate types, and tips in load screens to better
   explain Cataclysm mechanics.
   See what we thought of Anthem when it launched back in February in our
   review video above.
   But he acknowledged that those tweaks weren't enough, saying, "We hear
   your concerns on core issues in Anthem and are acting on it. Those
   systems require a more thorough review and re-working versus quick
   fixes. We’ve got a team working on that now, and early results are
   promising.
   “In order to address these long-range plans, we are moving away from
   the Acts structure for updates,” Robertson continued. “Instead, we have
   additional seasonal updates planned for this year that we think players
   will enjoy. These events will deliver challenges and chases similar to
   what you’ve seen, and are built around some fun themes we’re bringing
   to the game.”
   Bioware first unveiled it's post-launch content plans back in February,
   and promised three separate Acts that would expand the world and what
   players could do within it. Anthem is set on an unstable, unnamed
   planet where natural disasters and hostile creatures must be safely
   navigated, and each Act was meant to go deeper into the story and
   "ongoing narrative" of the game's universe.

   The first Act was delayed beyond its initial March launch date as
   Bioware struggled to overcome technical teething issues following the
   game's full release. The first Cataclysm event is only just coming to a
   close over six months later, having been pushed out the door amid the
   departure of Anthem's lead producer Ben Irving for a new opportunity.
   In April, a report by Kotaku cited numerous sources from within the
   studio that recounted an unhealthy culture and technical issues with
   EA's Frostbite engine.
   Robertson promised to be transparent with fans in the future about
   what's coming down the pipeline, but said "I don’t have any news today
   to share about the long-term changes we are bringing to Anthem."

Apex Legends: New Hero Crypto Officially Announced, Season 3 Details Revealed

Tales from the Crypto.

   Matt Kim

   By Matt Kim

   Posted: 19 Sep 2019 5:59 pm

   Crypto has been rumored to be Apex Legends’ next hero for a long time,
   and today Respawn confirmed they’ll be entering the tournament when the
   next season drops on October 1.

   Respawn released a new Stories from the Outlands trailer today that
   sheds a little light on Crypto’s backstory. According to the video,
   Crypto was just your average, mild-mannered hacker who discovered some
   kind of match-rigging program developed for the Apex Legends
   tournament. When a mysterious organization catches onto Crypto, they
   hunt his friends and family down, forcing Crypto to go on the run.
   You can watch the Crypto cinematic below.
   While the video didn’t reveal how Crypto plays, he’s seen in the
   trailer as using some kind of drone to help escape from his pursuers.
   This drone could play into Crypto’s gameplay moveset in some way.
   Crypto is already technically in Apex Legends. Players can find Crypto
   loitering around the map, hacking into servers before running away. You
   can see a glimpse of him in our video below.
   Alongside Crypto Respawn announced some more details about the upcoming
   season in Apex Legends. Titled, “Meltdown,” Apex Legends season 3 will
   feature a new battle pass with over 100 items, a new Charger Rifle
   weapon, and a new Ranked season.
   Check out IGN’s Apex Legends review and Apex Legends wiki for our full
   coverage of Respawn’s battle royale shooter.

Valve Will Appeal French Courts on Alleged 'Anti-Consumer' Ban on Digital
Games Resale

Otherwise, Valve has three months to change its policies.

   French courts have just struck down several user agreement clauses for
   Valve’s online PC storefront, Steam, including restrictions on the
   resale of digital games. Valve has announced that it will appeal the
   court’s decision.

   As reported by French publication Numerama, French consumer advocacy
   group UFC Que Choisir announced a legal victory against Steam today.
   According to the report, the group successfully got the courts to
   cancel clauses within Steam the group claims were anti-consumer. This
   includes Valve's policy against reselling digital games purchased from
   Steam.
   “The most significant of those concerns [was] the one that forbade the
   resale of [digital] video games," it says in the Numerama report. "That
   means the products are not related to a particular physical medium (a
   cartridge or a disk, for example).”

   In a statement sent to IGN on the French court ruling, Valve says: “We
   disagree with the decision of the Paris Court of First Instance and
   will appeal it. The decision will have no effect on Steam while the
   case is on appeal.”
   The French court claims that Valve’s prohibition on reselling digital
   games is against European Union laws on digital goods, which promotes
   free movement of goods within the Union. This includes digital
   software. Although Valve was told it has three months to amend its
   policies, Valve’s appeal will put any immediate changes on hold.

   Death Stranding is one of 2019’s biggest video game releases, and the
   first game from Kojima Productions since founder Hideo Kojima split
   with Konami. Since announcing Death Stranding at Sony’s E3 2016 press
   conference, most of the materials released for the game have been
   cryptic, cinematic trailers.
   Aside from starring actor Norman Reedus as the main character Sam, we
   learned that Sam works as a delivery man who must help reunite the
   United States by connecting cities through something called the Chiral
   Network. Sam is literally “bridging” the country together, but there
   happen to be test-tube babies and mysterious supernatural elements in
   play also.
   But with just months to go before the full launch, Kojima has shown off
   much more of Death Stranding, including important plot points, gameplay
   mechanics, combat, world, and more. Despite this, there are still
   plenty of questions surrounding Death Stranding.
   Check out every action moment from the Death Stranding gameplay in the
   video below.
   However, IGN’s in-depth translations reveal (for English speakers) just
   exactly what Kojima was saying during his 49-minute long gameplay demo
   at this year’s Tokyo Game Show. So watch the video to find out exactly
   what Kojima’s thought processes were during the demonstration.
   Kojima has also been heavily discussing the game in the leadup to its
   launch, including discussing how Death Stranding is meant to mirror
   modern-day politics, and that more games like Death Stranding may be
   needed to help create the new strand genre that Kojima says Death
   Stranding is pioneering.
   Death Stranding is out on November 8, so make sure to check out IGN’s
   full coverage on Kojima’s latest cinematic journey.

   If you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the
   sale. For more, learn more.
