In Defense of Fiction

   Zadie Smith
   I have closed novels and stared at their back covers for a long moment
   and felt known in a way I cannot honestly say I have felt known by many
   real-life interactions with human beings, or even by myself. For though
   the other may not know us perfectly or even well, the hard truth is we
   do not always know ourselves perfectly or well. Indeed, there are
   things to which subjectivity is blind and which only those on the
   outside can see.

Plans for an Escape to Carmelo

   Adolfo Bioy Casares, translated by Carole L. Kaye and Alberto Bolanos
   April 10, 1986 Issue

   It annoyed the professor when people slept late, but he didn’t want to
   awaken Valeria, because she enjoyed sleeping. “She is really very
   diligent,” he thought, studying her delicate profile and the profusion
   of red hair against the white pillowcase.

   The professor’s name was Felix Hernandez. He seemed young, as did so
   many of his age at that time (twenty years earlier they would have been
   old already). He was famous, even outside of the academic world, and
   much beloved by his students. He considered himself fortunate to be
   living with Valeria, a university student.

   He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Taking care to brown the
   toast just so, he remembered, “This morning Valeria will be defending
   her thesis. She must not forget the three periods of history.” After a
   pause he said: “Lately I’ve been talking to myself.”

   He carried the breakfast tray to the bedroom just as the girl was
   getting out of the shower, still wet and wrapped in a towel. As he
   handed her a cup, he caught sight of his own face in the mirror, with
   his salt-and-pepper beard that even recently shaved looked three days
   old. He looked at the girl, looked again in the mirror, and thought to
   himself, “Such a contrast. Really, I am quite fortunate.” The girl
   announced:

   —If I don’t wake up, I’m dead.

   —Because you won’t get your doctorate? You won’t be missing much.

   It is no longer understood that it is possible to study alone. Just
   because they’re in a classroom with a professor, students believe that
   they are studying. The universities, once fortresses of learning, have
   become patent offices. Nothing is more worthless than a university
   degree.

   The girl continued, as if speaking to herself:

   —I don’t care. I want the degree.

   —Well then, maybe it would be worth mentioning the three periods of
   history. When man believed that happiness was dependent upon God, he
   killed for religious reasons. When he believed that happiness was
   dependent upon the form of government, he killed for political reasons.

   —I read a poem. It said that each one kills the thing he loves.

   She looked at him, smiled, and shook her head.

   —After dreams that were too long, true nightmares—Hernandez went on to
   explain—we arrived at the present period of history. Man woke up,
   discovered that which he always knew, that happiness is dependent upon
   health, and began to kill for therapeutic reasons.

   —I think I’m going to start talking to the wall.

   —I don’t see why. Does anyone doubt that at a certain age he will
   receive a visit from the doctor? And isn’t that a form of killing? For
   therapeutic reasons, naturally. A way to kill the entire population.

   —Not the entire population. There are those who manage to escape to the
   other Zone.

   —And from there looms the threat of a second wave of killings. Immense.
   For therapeutic reasons, also.

   —But that’s only—she added with apparent distraction as she dressed—if
   we declare war on them.

Test Your Theory

   Norman Birnbaum, reply by Tom Bottomore
   September 21, 1972 Issue

In response to:

   Three Authors in Search of a Proletariat from the April 6, 1972 issue

   To the Editors:

   “The eventual test of any ‘critical theory’ or ‘sociology of
   opposition’ can only be the development, or failure to develop, of
   large-scale social movements which aim to create, and begin to create
   in practice, an egalitarian, noncoercive form of social life. In the
   meantime, the theory remains hypothetical. What justifies its existence
   at present, and makes such theoretical inquiry worthwhile, is the
   potentiality that has been revealed in the labor movement and in the
   new social movements of the past decade for a renewed activity to
   transform society” (Professor Tom Bottomore, NYR, April 6).

   Professor Bottomore’s intention, surely, is generous. He asks that no
   matter how abstract or profound a social theory, it express a human
   project—the radical transformation of social existence. He is right to
   imply that, in many circumstances, a theory unrelated to a project of
   this sort may prove sterile or worse, a legitimation of existing
   conditions. Are there not, however, other relationships between a
   critical theory of society and a project of social transformation?

   Firstly, a sociology engendered by a despairing conservativism may also
   produce truths (often enough, unpleasant ones) about social existence.
   An aristocratic disdain for bourgeois market relations found its way,
   in the nineteenth century, into aesthetic doctrines which were later
   transmuted into the elements of an oppositional social theory. The
   young Marx, after all, began as an unpublished romantic poet.

   Even reformist meliorism, frequently so despised, has developed a
   sociology or sociologies which have had important critical functions.
   Some of the best American sociology has been done by the Chicago
   School, an academic ancillary of middle-class social reform. There were
   similar trends in Germany with the “socialists of the lecture platform”
   and in France, where Durkheim and his followers constituted a social
   Jacobin party in the universities. Reformist sociologies of this type
   usually exhausted themselves: reform never seemed enough. Radical
   sociology has often begun, however, precisely after such defeats—and
   not necessarily in the context of a larger social movement.

   A critical or oppositional sociology often arises precisely when we
   despair of changing society. As Professor Bottomore points out, this
   was the origin of the work of the Frankfurt School. Were its insights
   into late capitalist society gratuitous, because it could not attach
   itself to a social group or class capable of transforming the social
   order? Are we to reject its work on the nature of industrial culture,
   on the modern personality structure, on new modes of domination and
   exploitation, because these do not issue in any direct way in a
   political program? The German student movement has uttered this
   criticism of its teachers in Frankfurt. Curiously—and
   interestingly—enough, that movement is now working its way back to
   something like a traditional alliance with the working class within the
   framework of conventional party and union politics. It has renounced,
   in other words, a direct connection between its critical theory and its
   political possibilities. All the same, its vision of these
   possibilities has been enriched by its theory.

   The demand that we understand the constraints upon us, even if we
   cannot immediately alter these, is an honorable one. The ability to
   reflect is a difficult, and fragile, human achievement. No social
   movement in a knowledge-based society can dispense with systematic
   reflection. Reflection, however, has its own rights and its own
   autonomy. Projects of transformation may well begin with insights
   seemingly utopian or futile. The theory may create a not inconsiderable
   piece of reality, and may itself evoke the beginnings of a social
   movement. If it does not, it may still retain its dignity and much of
   its value.

   Norman Birnbaum

   Amherst College

   Amherst, Massachusetts

Tom Bottomore replies:

   I don’t think Norman Birnbaum and I have any profound disagreement. He
   is right to point out that social criticism may originate in a variety
   of different circumstances; for example, from a conservative reaction
   against change, or from the defeat of a radical movement. But the
   appearance of a comprehensive critical theory—Marxism being the obvious
   example—does seem to me to be intimately linked with the rise and
   development of a new social movement aiming to change society in a
   radical way. In my review, however, I was not mainly concerned with the
   origins of criticism, but with questions, raised especially by Wellmer,
   about how a critical theory might be tested; and from this aspect it is
   crucial to consider whether social movements are developing which
   confirm, in some sense, the prognostications of the theory.

Data Leviathan: China’s Burgeoning Surveillance State

   Kenneth Roth and Maya Wang

   Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images
   Laser pointers being used by protesters in Hong Kong in an effort to
   defeat surveillance cameras and facial recognition software used by the
   authorities, China, August 7, 2019

   Classical totalitarianism, in which the state controls all institutions
   and most aspects of public life, largely died with the Soviet Union,
   apart from a few holdouts such as North Korea. The Chinese Communist
   Party retained a state monopoly in the political realm but allowed a
   significant private economy to flourish. Yet today, in Xinjiang, a
   region in China’s northwest, a new totalitarianism is emerging—one
   built not on state ownership of enterprises or property but on the
   state’s intrusive collection and analysis of information about the
   people there. Xinjiang shows us what a surveillance state looks like
   under a government that brooks no dissent and seeks to preclude the
   ability to fight back. And it demonstrates the power of personal
   information as a tool of social control.

   Xinjiang covers 16 percent of China’s landmass but includes only a tiny
   fraction of its population—22 million people, roughly 13 million of
   whom are Uighur and other Turkic Muslims, out of nearly 1.4 billion
   people in China. Hardly lax about security anywhere in the country, the
   Chinese government is especially preoccupied with it in Xinjiang,
   justifying the resulting repression as a fight against the “Three
   Evils” of “separatism, terrorism, and extremism.”

   Yet far from targeting bona fide criminals, Beijing’s actions in
   Xinjiang have been extraordinarily indiscriminate. As is now generally
   known, Chinese authorities have detained one million or more Turkic
   Muslims for political “re-education.” This latest “Strike Hard
   Campaign” has yielded the world’s largest case of mass arbitrary
   detention in decades.

   Beijing has tried to pass off the proliferating indoctrination centers
   as “vocational training” sites. In reality, the purpose is forced
   assimilation. Turkic Muslims are confined indefinitely until
   authorities determine that they have sufficiently replaced their
   religious and ethnic identity—their Islamic beliefs, language, culture,
   and traditions—with loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. In some
   areas, the government considers children with a parent or parents in
   detention to be “orphans” and holds them in state-run orphanages where
   they face similar brainwashing.

   But the use of mass detention is only part of Xinjiang’s story. What is
   even more striking is Beijing’s establishment there of a surveillance
   state, which plays a central role in determining who will be detained.
   The scope and intrusiveness of this effort may well be unprecedented.
   If this new form of totalitarianism is not curtailed, it portends a
   dystopia that other governments can be expected to emulate, threatening
   us all.

   Even in countries where the legal protection of privacy is more
   developed than in China, the law often lags far behind the changing
   technical capacities illustrated in Xinjiang. There is an urgent need
   to elaborate the right to privacy in concrete regulations that
   constrain a government’s surveillance powers, whether in China or the
   rest of the world.

                                      *

   The extraordinary nature of China’s surveillance effort in Xinjiang
   begins with the vast resources devoted to it. One million government
   employees are regularly dispatched to stay as “guests” in the homes of
   Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, with instructions to report any sign of
   religiosity or unusual thinking. The authorities have also recruited
   tens of thousands of new police officers for Xinjiang, set up thousands
   of new police stations and checkpoints throughout the region, and
   dramatically increased the public-security budget.

   Beijing then uses the latest technology to collect and analyze
   information gathered about Muslims there. Some Xinjiang checkpoints are
   equipped with special machines called “data doors” that—unbeknown to
   the people passing through them—vacuum up identifying information from
   their mobile phones and other electronic devices. Machine-readable QR
   codes are engraved on knives and posted on people’s front doors (and
   officials are equipped with mobile apps to scan them), allowing the
   authorities to quickly link individuals to their homes and possessions.
   To track, monitor, and profile Turkic Muslims, agents also rely on
   artificial intelligence, including facial and number-plate recognition,
   which have been connected with  surveillance cameras that blanket both
   the region and other parts of the country. In addition, the authorities
   collect biometric data—including voice samples, iris scans, and DNA—and
   store them in searchable databases.

   Chinese authorities have had to deploy a new and innovative system to
   integrate, sort, and analyze this enormous quantity of data. The mobile
   app that police and other officials use to communicate with the
   Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), one of the main policing
   platforms that Xinjiang authorities deploy, provides insight into this
   system.

   Based on its aggregated data, the IJOP program flags for officials
   anyone deemed a potential threat. Some of those suspects are targeted
   for further investigation, and some for detention and re-education. By
   “reverse-engineering” this mobile app—looking at its source code—our
   organization, Human Rights Watch (HRW), was able to look inside it to
   see the vast array of information collected. The breadth of that
   intelligence-gathering helps to explain the bewildering set of
   questions that Xinjiang residents report being asked by the police.

   That information ranges from obvious personal attributes—a person’s
   blood type or height—to their “religious atmosphere” and political
   affiliations. It includes whether someone has obtained a new phone
   number, donated to a mosque, or preached the Qur’an without
   authorization. The platform incorporates assessments of whether a
   person might not be “socializing with neighbors” or is “often avoiding
   using the front door.” If a phone suddenly goes “off-grid,” the system
   sends an alert to an official nearby to investigate. All of this
   information is fed into the Integrated Joint Operations Platform’s
   central system and linked to a person’s national identification card
   number.

   In some cases, investigations require officials to check people’s
   phones. One Turkic Muslim from Xinjiang told HRW what happened when he
   was pulled over by police in a traffic stop: “SWAT police officers came
   and demanded that I give them my phone. I did, and they plugged the
   phone in.” A few days later, his wife experienced a similar check on
   her phone while they were stopped at a gas station. The platform
   considers “suspicious” fifty-one types of software and communications
   systems, including VPNs, as well as software that permits end-to-end
   encryption such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram.

   The platform predictably devotes special interest to personal
   relationships: Is a person in question connected to someone who has
   recently obtained a new phone number? Has that person traveled with
   someone whom the authorities find problematic? Is the person in contact
   with anyone abroad?

   The scope of the surveillance can be terrifying to Xinjiang residents,
   who have no ability to challenge it. “There is a place I go at night
   that nobody knows. But the app knows. That’s when I got really scared,”
   said a Uighur Muslim who was familiar with the system from his time in
   Xinjiang, when shown the reverse–engineered app. Once, he input his
   friend’s ID card number into the system and was shocked when the app
   spat out “immediate arrest.”

   The platform works with the region’s many checkpoints so that, when
   people pass through, their movement can be restricted depending on how
   “trustworthy” the computer system (or its programmers) deems them.
   Former residents said they have been stopped at checkpoints and taken
   for police interrogation simply because their relatives were being held
   in a political re-education camp. The system also stops people who are
   traveling to a different location from the one where they are
   registered to live. The effect of all this is to impose a series of
   digital fences around Xinjiang residents.

   The use of mass surveillance is not limited to Xinjiang. The Chinese
   police are researching and putting similar mass surveillance systems in
   operation throughout the country. For example, Human Rights Watch has
   documented the use of a big-data policing platform called Police Cloud,
   which collects and integrates people’s personal data—from their
   supermarket memberships to their health records.

   Another system designed to shape social behavior is the “social credit”
   system that Chinese authorities are developing. Under this system,
   which the government has begun to put into operation and hopes to roll
   out more fully by 2020, people are, as it says, “rewarded
   everywhere” for good social behavior and “restricted everywhere” for
   bad behavior. Some types of measured behavior might seem relatively
   innocuous, such as whether a person obeys traffic regulations, pays
   court fines, or refrains from eating on public transport. But it would
   take little to add political criteria.

   The details of the system vary in different parts of the country but
   have in common an attempt to link social reliability to eligibility for
   desirable social goods. Does one get residency in an attractive city?
   The ability to send one’s children to a private school? Permission to
   travel on a plane or high-speed train?

   The ingenuity of these social control systems is that, for most people,
   the desire for such social benefits will be enough to keep them in
   line, even without the threat of detention. That is all the more true
   because most people in China, for reasons of self-preservation, already
   exercise a significant degree of self-censorship. They know to refrain
   from publicly criticizing the government and to keep their distance
   from outspoken acquaintances.

   Given the human resources needed to build and maintain such elaborate
   systems of social control, the Chinese government recognizes that it
   must also monitor and regulate the conduct of the large number of
   police and bureaucrats who operate the system, particularly because
   many of the tasks involved are tedious and grueling. The Xinjiang
   police officer who completes the eleven pages of information requested
   by the Integrated Joint Operating Platform is engaged in pages and
   pages of the most mundane process of data collection. The app monitors
   how well officers carry out these tasks, giving them a score that is
   available to both the officer and his or her supervisors.

   Technology also helps to ease any qualms that police officers might
   have about the consequences of their work. Unlike the executioner or
   the torturer who knows that what he is doing is wrong, the officer
   inputting material into the platform is just doing routine police work,
   albeit with an unusual level of intrusiveness. The resulting evil is
   the consequence of computer programs, managed by siloed parts of the
   police state, that determine who is to be arrested. Responsibility is
   diffuse.

                                      *

   Taken together, these surveillance powers in Xinjiang suggest that the
   Chinese government is perfecting a system of social control that is
   both all-encompassing and highly individualized, using a mix of
   mechanisms to impose varying levels of supervision and constraint on
   people depending on their perceived threat to the state. John Garnaut,
   an expert on Chinese politics, traced from Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping the
   Communist Party leaders’ lineage as “engineers of the soul.” Both Mao
   and Xi shared the belief that humans can be conditioned “in the same
   way that [the Russian psychologist] Pavlov had learned to condition
   dogs” by “controlling all incentives and disincentives” in their lives,
   he said. That is why the Chinese government under Xi—who enjoys greater
   resources, more advanced technologies, and a stronger bureaucracy than
   Mao—rarely needs to resort to overt violence.

   That is also why, for most people in China, life can seem “normal,”
   despite the social controls. This illusory effect also works in China’s
   favor abroad, because many visitors miss how carefully and coercively
   choregraphed its superficial calm is. Yet even in Hong Kong—a city
   under Chinese sovereignty that still retains some freedoms—many
   participants in the continuing pro-democracy protests are taking steps
   to protect themselves, with measures such as turning off
   location-tracking on their phones, buying old-format subway cards with
   cash, pointing laser beams at surveillance cameras, wearing face masks,
   and switching to encrypted communication platforms like Telegram to
   avoid identification and tracking.

   Terrifying as the emerging system of social control is, though, it has
   its limits. Researchers developing these surveillance systems have
   bemoaned the difficulty of mining genuinely useful analytics from such
   huge quantities of data. Among the problems cited are that frontline
   officers lack the motivation to collect data accurately, or that
   surveillance systems developed by different companies are not fully
   compatible. While the ubiquity of surveillance tools, from biometric
   databases linked to national ID numbers to pervasive surveillance
   cameras, suggests fearsome capabilities, many of these systems do not
   yet work as intended.

   What can be done to curtail this system? Publicly criticizing it is the
   first step. Despite their façade of imperviousness, the Chinese
   authorities have shown themselves to be sensitive to criticism. As
   media attention to the mass detention of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims
   mounts, the Chinese government has felt the heat; it has organized
   show-tours for diplomats and journalists as part of an effort to pass
   off the detention centers as benign. The tours have not been terribly
   convincing—in one case, inmates were compelled to sing, in English, the
   children’s song “If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands”—but
   the charade gives other governments an excuse not to pick a fight with
   a powerful economic actor.

   In July, twenty-four governments at the United Nations Human Rights
   Council in Geneva issued—for the first time in such numbers—a statement
   of concern about China, focusing on the mass detentions in Xinjiang.
   The statement shows that, despite China’s economic power, these
   governments will try to hold Beijing to the same standard as they would
   other abusive governments. China immediately countered by orchestrating
   its own statement of support, although it had to rely on the likes of
   North Korea, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Syria, and Russia. One
   Chinese official even claimed—though there is no known evidence to
   support his statement—that in Xinjiang “over 90 percent of the students
   have returned to society and returned to their families and are living
   happily.”

   However ham-fisted these responses, they show that international
   criticism has struck a nerve, that the Chinese government cares about
   its reputation and knows that what it is doing to the Turkic Muslim
   population of Xinjiang is difficult to defend. Its reaction indicates
   the importance of continuing to shine a spotlight on the extraordinary
   system of surveillance and detention that it has erected in Xinjiang.

   Beijing also seems to fear the growing efforts by other governments to
   impose targeted sanctions on companies and individuals that help to
   build or operate this surveillance system. In February, Thermo Fisher
   Scientific, a large US-based medical technology manufacturer, announced
   that it would stop selling human identification technology to the
   Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. In July, in another sign of
   defensiveness, China opted to send a lower-ranking official—rather than
   Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, whom many have suggested should
   be targeted for sanctions—to defend its repressive policies at the UN
   Human Rights Council.

   Ultimately, however, global protections for privacy need to be
   strengthened in the face of the state’s new technical capacities for
   surveillance and analysis. Citizens are starting from a position of
   weakness. The US government, for example, has long taken a minimalist
   view of the right to privacy. It maintains that we lose our right to
   privacy in such matters as the phone numbers that we dial or the
   addresses to which we send emails because we “share” that information
   with the phone or internet company—as if, in the modern age, we had any
   meaningful choice. The US government has backed off that position only
   when the Supreme Court has compelled it to do so, such as when the
   court ruled in 2018 that people have an expectation of privacy in data
   that communications service providers gather about their locations.

   International standards, as laid out by the United Nations’ Office of
   the High Commissioner for Human Rights, make clear that information
   about our communications, just like the content of a message, is
   protected by the human right to privacy. This means that a government
   can gather such data only when doing so is legal under domestic and
   international law, as well as necessary and proportionate to achieving
   a legitimate goal. However, not just the United States but many
   governments around the world as well have a long way to go in
   recognizing this aspect of privacy rights.

   Similarly, citizens are used to thinking about privacy as something
   that exists only behind closed doors, but in fact we expect a degree of
   privacy even as we go about our day-to-day affairs in public.
   Government agents could physically follow us, but the time and expense
   required to do so means that for most people they never bother. But the
   dynamics have changed now that most of us carry tracking devices with
   us everywhere we go—that is, our smart phones—and the government can
   with relative ease reconstruct our lives by capturing and analyzing
   that data. The US Supreme Court, as noted, recently recognized that we
   do have a privacy interest even as we go about our public lives, though
   this is a relatively new concept that needs to be developed.

   In an earlier age, an extensive repository of information such as the
   one built by Chinese authorities about Muslims in Xinjiang would have
   been of limited utility because security officials would have had to
   comb through it manually. That would have allowed them to focus on
   selected individuals, but any effort at large-scale monitoring would
   have been overwhelming. Today, however, advances in machine-learning
   and data analytics enable the detection of “suspicious” patterns of
   behavior, such as “overuse” of electricity, that might not be apparent
   even to a trained detective.

   Of course, even were other governments to embrace privacy protections,
   the Chinese state would be unlikely to join them. And supposing China
   were to subscribe theoretically to standards on surveillance, as it has
   for some human rights standards, residents would have no capacity to
   enforce them. Chinese citizens have no independent judiciary and no
   meaningful right to petition or protest against governmental
   misconduct.

   All the same, international standards can exert influence even on a
   government like China’s once a critical mass of other countries shows
   it is ready to abide by those standards. Although, for example, when
   the 1997 treaty banning landmines was adopted, a number of major powers
   including China, Russia, and the United States refused to ratify it, a
   sufficiently large number of governments did embrace the accord. As a
   result, landmines became stigmatized as an indiscriminate weapon, and
   few governments would now admit to using them, whether or not they have
   ratified the treaty. The same process occurred after the international
   adoption of treaties banning cluster munitions and child soldiers.

   The next step in checking the new surveillance apparatus is for civic
   groups to organize and press the world’s leading governments to develop
   and promote privacy protections for the modern technological world. The
   aim should not be a universally endorsed treaty. That would produce a
   lowest-common-denominator standard that would sell short our privacy
   rights. Instead, the objective should be to secure the endorsement of
   strong standards by a sufficient number of governments to stigmatize
   certain intrusions on our privacy. The focus should be to exercise
   restraint on the large-scale collection and transfer of personal data
   that can be used to profile whole populations; regulation of state
   acquisition and deployment of biodata such as DNA, facial images, or
   voice samples; meaningful export controls on surveillance technology;
   and transparency and public audit requirements for machine-learning
   tools deployed by governments that can affect basic rights.

   Such measures, even if widely adopted, would not be a panacea. In many
   cases, they would not be legally enforceable. But they would make an
   important contribution to the development of broadly accepted
   international norms on the limits of surveillance. Those norms,
   combined with the opprobrium visited upon governments that violate
   them, are the best practical way we have to push back against the
   surveillance-state Leviathan that Beijing has built to monitor and
   control the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang.

Plans for an Escape to Carmelo

   Adolfo Bioy Casares, translated by Carole L. Kaye and Alberto Bolanos
   April 10, 1986 Issue

   It annoyed the professor when people slept late, but he didn’t want to
   awaken Valeria, because she enjoyed sleeping. “She is really very
   diligent,” he thought, studying her delicate profile and the profusion
   of red hair against the white pillowcase.

   The professor’s name was Felix Hernandez. He seemed young, as did so
   many of his age at that time (twenty years earlier they would have been
   old already). He was famous, even outside of the academic world, and
   much beloved by his students. He considered himself fortunate to be
   living with Valeria, a university student.

   He went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Taking care to brown the
   toast just so, he remembered, “This morning Valeria will be defending
   her thesis. She must not forget the three periods of history.” After a
   pause he said: “Lately I’ve been talking to myself.”

   He carried the breakfast tray to the bedroom just as the girl was
   getting out of the shower, still wet and wrapped in a towel. As he
   handed her a cup, he caught sight of his own face in the mirror, with
   his salt-and-pepper beard that even recently shaved looked three days
   old. He looked at the girl, looked again in the mirror, and thought to
   himself, “Such a contrast. Really, I am quite fortunate.” The girl
   announced:

   —If I don’t wake up, I’m dead.

   —Because you won’t get your doctorate? You won’t be missing much.

   It is no longer understood that it is possible to study alone. Just
   because they’re in a classroom with a professor, students believe that
   they are studying. The universities, once fortresses of learning, have
   become patent offices. Nothing is more worthless than a university
   degree.

   The girl continued, as if speaking to herself:

   —I don’t care. I want the degree.

   —Well then, maybe it would be worth mentioning the three periods of
   history. When man believed that happiness was dependent upon God, he
   killed for religious reasons. When he believed that happiness was
   dependent upon the form of government, he killed for political reasons.

   —I read a poem. It said that each one kills the thing he loves.

   She looked at him, smiled, and shook her head.

   —After dreams that were too long, true nightmares—Hernandez went on to
   explain—we arrived at the present period of history. Man woke up,
   discovered that which he always knew, that happiness is dependent upon
   health, and began to kill for therapeutic reasons.

   —I think I’m going to start talking to the wall.

   —I don’t see why. Does anyone doubt that at a certain age he will
   receive a visit from the doctor? And isn’t that a form of killing? For
   therapeutic reasons, naturally. A way to kill the entire population.

   —Not the entire population. There are those who manage to escape to the
   other Zone.

   —And from there looms the threat of a second wave of killings. Immense.
   For therapeutic reasons, also.

   —But that’s only—she added with apparent distraction as she dressed—if
   we declare war on them.

Test Your Theory

   Norman Birnbaum, reply by Tom Bottomore
   September 21, 1972 Issue

In response to:

   Three Authors in Search of a Proletariat from the April 6, 1972 issue

   To the Editors:

   “The eventual test of any ‘critical theory’ or ‘sociology of
   opposition’ can only be the development, or failure to develop, of
   large-scale social movements which aim to create, and begin to create
   in practice, an egalitarian, noncoercive form of social life. In the
   meantime, the theory remains hypothetical. What justifies its existence
   at present, and makes such theoretical inquiry worthwhile, is the
   potentiality that has been revealed in the labor movement and in the
   new social movements of the past decade for a renewed activity to
   transform society” (Professor Tom Bottomore, NYR, April 6).

   Professor Bottomore’s intention, surely, is generous. He asks that no
   matter how abstract or profound a social theory, it express a human
   project—the radical transformation of social existence. He is right to
   imply that, in many circumstances, a theory unrelated to a project of
   this sort may prove sterile or worse, a legitimation of existing
   conditions. Are there not, however, other relationships between a
   critical theory of society and a project of social transformation?

   Firstly, a sociology engendered by a despairing conservativism may also
   produce truths (often enough, unpleasant ones) about social existence.
   An aristocratic disdain for bourgeois market relations found its way,
   in the nineteenth century, into aesthetic doctrines which were later
   transmuted into the elements of an oppositional social theory. The
   young Marx, after all, began as an unpublished romantic poet.

   Even reformist meliorism, frequently so despised, has developed a
   sociology or sociologies which have had important critical functions.
   Some of the best American sociology has been done by the Chicago
   School, an academic ancillary of middle-class social reform. There were
   similar trends in Germany with the “socialists of the lecture platform”
   and in France, where Durkheim and his followers constituted a social
   Jacobin party in the universities. Reformist sociologies of this type
   usually exhausted themselves: reform never seemed enough. Radical
   sociology has often begun, however, precisely after such defeats—and
   not necessarily in the context of a larger social movement.

   A critical or oppositional sociology often arises precisely when we
   despair of changing society. As Professor Bottomore points out, this
   was the origin of the work of the Frankfurt School. Were its insights
   into late capitalist society gratuitous, because it could not attach
   itself to a social group or class capable of transforming the social
   order? Are we to reject its work on the nature of industrial culture,
   on the modern personality structure, on new modes of domination and
   exploitation, because these do not issue in any direct way in a
   political program? The German student movement has uttered this
   criticism of its teachers in Frankfurt. Curiously—and
   interestingly—enough, that movement is now working its way back to
   something like a traditional alliance with the working class within the
   framework of conventional party and union politics. It has renounced,
   in other words, a direct connection between its critical theory and its
   political possibilities. All the same, its vision of these
   possibilities has been enriched by its theory.

   The demand that we understand the constraints upon us, even if we
   cannot immediately alter these, is an honorable one. The ability to
   reflect is a difficult, and fragile, human achievement. No social
   movement in a knowledge-based society can dispense with systematic
   reflection. Reflection, however, has its own rights and its own
   autonomy. Projects of transformation may well begin with insights
   seemingly utopian or futile. The theory may create a not inconsiderable
   piece of reality, and may itself evoke the beginnings of a social
   movement. If it does not, it may still retain its dignity and much of
   its value.

   Amherst College

   Amherst, Massachusetts

Tom Bottomore replies:

   I don’t think Norman Birnbaum and I have any profound disagreement. He
   is right to point out that social criticism may originate in a variety
   of different circumstances; for example, from a conservative reaction
   against change, or from the defeat of a radical movement. But the
   appearance of a comprehensive critical theory—Marxism being the obvious
   example—does seem to me to be intimately linked with the rise and
   development of a new social movement aiming to change society in a
   radical way. In my review, however, I was not mainly concerned with the
   origins of criticism, but with questions, raised especially by Wellmer,
   about how a critical theory might be tested; and from this aspect it is
   crucial to consider whether social movements are developing which
   confirm, in some sense, the prognostications of the theory.

Data Leviathan: China’s Burgeoning Surveillance State

   Kenneth Roth and Maya Wang

   Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images
   Laser pointers being used by protesters in Hong Kong in an effort to
   defeat surveillance cameras and facial recognition software used by the
   authorities, China, August 7, 2019

   Classical totalitarianism, in which the state controls all institutions
   and most aspects of public life, largely died with the Soviet Union,
   apart from a few holdouts such as North Korea. The Chinese Communist
   Party retained a state monopoly in the political realm but allowed a
   significant private economy to flourish. Yet today, in Xinjiang, a
   region in China’s northwest, a new totalitarianism is emerging—one
   built not on state ownership of enterprises or property but on the
   state’s intrusive collection and analysis of information about the
   people there. Xinjiang shows us what a surveillance state looks like
   under a government that brooks no dissent and seeks to preclude the
   ability to fight back. And it demonstrates the power of personal
   information as a tool of social control.

   Xinjiang covers 16 percent of China’s landmass but includes only a tiny
   fraction of its population—22 million people, roughly 13 million of
   whom are Uighur and other Turkic Muslims, out of nearly 1.4 billion
   people in China. Hardly lax about security anywhere in the country, the
   Chinese government is especially preoccupied with it in Xinjiang,
   justifying the resulting repression as a fight against the “Three
   Evils” of “separatism, terrorism, and extremism.”

   Yet far from targeting bona fide criminals, Beijing’s actions in
   Xinjiang have been extraordinarily indiscriminate. As is now generally
   known, Chinese authorities have detained one million or more Turkic
   Muslims for political “re-education.” This latest “Strike Hard
   Campaign” has yielded the world’s largest case of mass arbitrary
   detention in decades.

   Beijing has tried to pass off the proliferating indoctrination centers
   as “vocational training” sites. In reality, the purpose is forced
   assimilation. Turkic Muslims are confined indefinitely until
   authorities determine that they have sufficiently replaced their
   religious and ethnic identity—their Islamic beliefs, language, culture,
   and traditions—with loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. In some
   areas, the government considers children with a parent or parents in
   detention to be “orphans” and holds them in state-run orphanages where
   they face similar brainwashing.

   But the use of mass detention is only part of Xinjiang’s story. What is
   even more striking is Beijing’s establishment there of a surveillance
   state, which plays a central role in determining who will be detained.
   The scope and intrusiveness of this effort may well be unprecedented.
   If this new form of totalitarianism is not curtailed, it portends a
   dystopia that other governments can be expected to emulate, threatening
   us all.

   Even in countries where the legal protection of privacy is more
   developed than in China, the law often lags far behind the changing
   technical capacities illustrated in Xinjiang. There is an urgent need
   to elaborate the right to privacy in concrete regulations that
   constrain a government’s surveillance powers, whether in China or the
   rest of the world.

                                      *

   The extraordinary nature of China’s surveillance effort in Xinjiang
   begins with the vast resources devoted to it. One million government
   employees are regularly dispatched to stay as “guests” in the homes of
   Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, with instructions to report any sign of
   religiosity or unusual thinking. The authorities have also recruited
   tens of thousands of new police officers for Xinjiang, set up thousands
   of new police stations and checkpoints throughout the region, and
   dramatically increased the public-security budget.

   Beijing then uses the latest technology to collect and analyze
   information gathered about Muslims there. Some Xinjiang checkpoints are
   equipped with special machines called “data doors” that—unbeknown to
   the people passing through them—vacuum up identifying information from
   their mobile phones and other electronic devices. Machine-readable QR
   codes are engraved on knives and posted on people’s front doors (and
   officials are equipped with mobile apps to scan them), allowing the
   authorities to quickly link individuals to their homes and possessions.
   To track, monitor, and profile Turkic Muslims, agents also rely on
   artificial intelligence, including facial and number-plate recognition,
   which have been connected with  surveillance cameras that blanket both
   the region and other parts of the country. In addition, the authorities
   collect biometric data—including voice samples, iris scans, and DNA—and
   store them in searchable databases.

   Chinese authorities have had to deploy a new and innovative system to
   integrate, sort, and analyze this enormous quantity of data. The mobile
   app that police and other officials use to communicate with the
   Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), one of the main policing
   platforms that Xinjiang authorities deploy, provides insight into this
   system.

   Based on its aggregated data, the IJOP program flags for officials
   anyone deemed a potential threat. Some of those suspects are targeted
   for further investigation, and some for detention and re-education. By
   “reverse-engineering” this mobile app—looking at its source code—our
   organization, Human Rights Watch (HRW), was able to look inside it to
   see the vast array of information collected. The breadth of that
   intelligence-gathering helps to explain the bewildering set of
   questions that Xinjiang residents report being asked by the police.

   That information ranges from obvious personal attributes—a person’s
   blood type or height—to their “religious atmosphere” and political
   affiliations. It includes whether someone has obtained a new phone
   number, donated to a mosque, or preached the Qur’an without
   authorization. The platform incorporates assessments of whether a
   person might not be “socializing with neighbors” or is “often avoiding
   using the front door.” If a phone suddenly goes “off-grid,” the system
   sends an alert to an official nearby to investigate. All of this
   information is fed into the Integrated Joint Operations Platform’s
   central system and linked to a person’s national identification card
   number.

   In some cases, investigations require officials to check people’s
   phones. One Turkic Muslim from Xinjiang told HRW what happened when he
   was pulled over by police in a traffic stop: “SWAT police officers came
   and demanded that I give them my phone. I did, and they plugged the
   phone in.” A few days later, his wife experienced a similar check on
   her phone while they were stopped at a gas station. The platform
   considers “suspicious” fifty-one types of software and communications
   systems, including VPNs, as well as software that permits end-to-end
   encryption such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram.

   The platform predictably devotes special interest to personal
   relationships: Is a person in question connected to someone who has
   recently obtained a new phone number? Has that person traveled with
   someone whom the authorities find problematic? Is the person in contact
   with anyone abroad?

   The scope of the surveillance can be terrifying to Xinjiang residents,
   who have no ability to challenge it. “There is a place I go at night
   that nobody knows. But the app knows. That’s when I got really scared,”
   said a Uighur Muslim who was familiar with the system from his time in
   Xinjiang, when shown the reverse–engineered app. Once, he input his
   friend’s ID card number into the system and was shocked when the app
   spat out “immediate arrest.”

   The platform works with the region’s many checkpoints so that, when
   people pass through, their movement can be restricted depending on how
   “trustworthy” the computer system (or its programmers) deems them.
   Former residents said they have been stopped at checkpoints and taken
   for police interrogation simply because their relatives were being held
   in a political re-education camp. The system also stops people who are
   traveling to a different location from the one where they are
   registered to live. The effect of all this is to impose a series of
   digital fences around Xinjiang residents.

   The use of mass surveillance is not limited to Xinjiang. The Chinese
   police are researching and putting similar mass surveillance systems in
   operation throughout the country. For example, Human Rights Watch has
   documented the use of a big-data policing platform called Police Cloud,
   which collects and integrates people’s personal data—from their
   supermarket memberships to their health records.

   Another system designed to shape social behavior is the “social credit”
   system that Chinese authorities are developing. Under this system,
   which the government has begun to put into operation and hopes to roll
   out more fully by 2020, people are, as it says, “rewarded
   everywhere” for good social behavior and “restricted everywhere” for
   bad behavior. Some types of measured behavior might seem relatively
   innocuous, such as whether a person obeys traffic regulations, pays
   court fines, or refrains from eating on public transport. But it would
   take little to add political criteria.

   The details of the system vary in different parts of the country but
   have in common an attempt to link social reliability to eligibility for
   desirable social goods. Does one get residency in an attractive city?
   The ability to send one’s children to a private school? Permission to
   travel on a plane or high-speed train?

   The ingenuity of these social control systems is that, for most people,
   the desire for such social benefits will be enough to keep them in
   line, even without the threat of detention. That is all the more true
   because most people in China, for reasons of self-preservation, already
   exercise a significant degree of self-censorship. They know to refrain
   from publicly criticizing the government and to keep their distance
   from outspoken acquaintances.

   Given the human resources needed to build and maintain such elaborate
   systems of social control, the Chinese government recognizes that it
   must also monitor and regulate the conduct of the large number of
   police and bureaucrats who operate the system, particularly because
   many of the tasks involved are tedious and grueling. The Xinjiang
   police officer who completes the eleven pages of information requested
   by the Integrated Joint Operating Platform is engaged in pages and
   pages of the most mundane process of data collection. The app monitors
   how well officers carry out these tasks, giving them a score that is
   available to both the officer and his or her supervisors.

   Technology also helps to ease any qualms that police officers might
   have about the consequences of their work. Unlike the executioner or
   the torturer who knows that what he is doing is wrong, the officer
   inputting material into the platform is just doing routine police work,
   albeit with an unusual level of intrusiveness. The resulting evil is
   the consequence of computer programs, managed by siloed parts of the
   police state, that determine who is to be arrested. Responsibility is
   diffuse.

   Taken together, these surveillance powers in Xinjiang suggest that the
   Chinese government is perfecting a system of social control that is
   both all-encompassing and highly individualized, using a mix of
   mechanisms to impose varying levels of supervision and constraint on
   people depending on their perceived threat to the state. John Garnaut,
   an expert on Chinese politics, traced from Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping the
   Communist Party leaders’ lineage as “engineers of the soul.” Both Mao
   and Xi shared the belief that humans can be conditioned “in the same
   way that [the Russian psychologist] Pavlov had learned to condition
   dogs” by “controlling all incentives and disincentives” in their lives,
   he said. That is why the Chinese government under Xi—who enjoys greater
   resources, more advanced technologies, and a stronger bureaucracy than
   Mao—rarely needs to resort to overt violence.

   That is also why, for most people in China, life can seem “normal,”
   despite the social controls. This illusory effect also works in China’s
   favor abroad, because many visitors miss how carefully and coercively
   choregraphed its superficial calm is. Yet even in Hong Kong—a city
   under Chinese sovereignty that still retains some freedoms—many
   participants in the continuing pro-democracy protests are taking steps
   to protect themselves, with measures such as turning off
   location-tracking on their phones, buying old-format subway cards with
   cash, pointing laser beams at surveillance cameras, wearing face masks,
   and switching to encrypted communication platforms like Telegram to
   avoid identification and tracking.

   Terrifying as the emerging system of social control is, though, it has
   its limits. Researchers developing these surveillance systems have
   bemoaned the difficulty of mining genuinely useful analytics from such
   huge quantities of data. Among the problems cited are that frontline
   officers lack the motivation to collect data accurately, or that
   surveillance systems developed by different companies are not fully
   compatible. While the ubiquity of surveillance tools, from biometric
   databases linked to national ID numbers to pervasive surveillance
   cameras, suggests fearsome capabilities, many of these systems do not
   yet work as intended.

   What can be done to curtail this system? Publicly criticizing it is the
   first step. Despite their façade of imperviousness, the Chinese
   authorities have shown themselves to be sensitive to criticism. As
   media attention to the mass detention of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims
   mounts, the Chinese government has felt the heat; it has organized
   show-tours for diplomats and journalists as part of an effort to pass
   off the detention centers as benign. The tours have not been terribly
   convincing—in one case, inmates were compelled to sing, in English, the
   children’s song “If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands”—but
   the charade gives other governments an excuse not to pick a fight with
   a powerful economic actor.

   In July, twenty-four governments at the United Nations Human Rights
   Council in Geneva issued—for the first time in such numbers—a statement
   of concern about China, focusing on the mass detentions in Xinjiang.
   The statement shows that, despite China’s economic power, these
   governments will try to hold Beijing to the same standard as they would
   other abusive governments. China immediately countered by orchestrating
   its own statement of support, although it had to rely on the likes of
   North Korea, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Syria, and Russia. One
   Chinese official even claimed—though there is no known evidence to
   support his statement—that in Xinjiang “over 90 percent of the students
   have returned to society and returned to their families and are living
   happily.”

   However ham-fisted these responses, they show that international
   criticism has struck a nerve, that the Chinese government cares about
   its reputation and knows that what it is doing to the Turkic Muslim
   population of Xinjiang is difficult to defend. Its reaction indicates
   the importance of continuing to shine a spotlight on the extraordinary
   system of surveillance and detention that it has erected in Xinjiang.

   Beijing also seems to fear the growing efforts by other governments to
   impose targeted sanctions on companies and individuals that help to
   build or operate this surveillance system. In February, Thermo Fisher
   Scientific, a large US-based medical technology manufacturer, announced
   that it would stop selling human identification technology to the
   Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. In July, in another sign of
   defensiveness, China opted to send a lower-ranking official—rather than
   Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, whom many have suggested should
   be targeted for sanctions—to defend its repressive policies at the UN
   Human Rights Council.

   Ultimately, however, global protections for privacy need to be
   strengthened in the face of the state’s new technical capacities for
   surveillance and analysis. Citizens are starting from a position of
   weakness. The US government, for example, has long taken a minimalist
   view of the right to privacy. It maintains that we lose our right to
   privacy in such matters as the phone numbers that we dial or the
   addresses to which we send emails because we “share” that information
   with the phone or internet company—as if, in the modern age, we had any
   meaningful choice. The US government has backed off that position only
   when the Supreme Court has compelled it to do so, such as when the
   court ruled in 2018 that people have an expectation of privacy in data
   that communications service providers gather about their locations.

   International standards, as laid out by the United Nations’ Office of
   the High Commissioner for Human Rights, make clear that information
   about our communications, just like the content of a message, is
   protected by the human right to privacy. This means that a government
   can gather such data only when doing so is legal under domestic and
   international law, as well as necessary and proportionate to achieving
   a legitimate goal. However, not just the United States but many
   governments around the world as well have a long way to go in
   recognizing this aspect of privacy rights.

   Similarly, citizens are used to thinking about privacy as something
   that exists only behind closed doors, but in fact we expect a degree of
   privacy even as we go about our day-to-day affairs in public.
   Government agents could physically follow us, but the time and expense
   required to do so means that for most people they never bother. But the
   dynamics have changed now that most of us carry tracking devices with
   us everywhere we go—that is, our smart phones—and the government can
   with relative ease reconstruct our lives by capturing and analyzing
   that data. The US Supreme Court, as noted, recently recognized that we
   do have a privacy interest even as we go about our public lives, though
   this is a relatively new concept that needs to be developed.

   In an earlier age, an extensive repository of information such as the
   one built by Chinese authorities about Muslims in Xinjiang would have
   been of limited utility because security officials would have had to
   comb through it manually. That would have allowed them to focus on
   selected individuals, but any effort at large-scale monitoring would
   have been overwhelming. Today, however, advances in machine-learning
   and data analytics enable the detection of “suspicious” patterns of
   behavior, such as “overuse” of electricity, that might not be apparent
   even to a trained detective.

   Of course, even were other governments to embrace privacy protections,
   the Chinese state would be unlikely to join them. And supposing China
   were to subscribe theoretically to standards on surveillance, as it has
   for some human rights standards, residents would have no capacity to
   enforce them. Chinese citizens have no independent judiciary and no
   meaningful right to petition or protest against governmental
   misconduct.

   All the same, international standards can exert influence even on a
   government like China’s once a critical mass of other countries shows
   it is ready to abide by those standards. Although, for example, when
   the 1997 treaty banning landmines was adopted, a number of major powers
   including China, Russia, and the United States refused to ratify it, a
   sufficiently large number of governments did embrace the accord. As a
   result, landmines became stigmatized as an indiscriminate weapon, and
   few governments would now admit to using them, whether or not they have
   ratified the treaty. The same process occurred after the international
   adoption of treaties banning cluster munitions and child soldiers.

   The next step in checking the new surveillance apparatus is for civic
   groups to organize and press the world’s leading governments to develop
   and promote privacy protections for the modern technological world. The
   aim should not be a universally endorsed treaty. That would produce a
   lowest-common-denominator standard that would sell short our privacy
   rights. Instead, the objective should be to secure the endorsement of
   strong standards by a sufficient number of governments to stigmatize
   certain intrusions on our privacy. The focus should be to exercise
   restraint on the large-scale collection and transfer of personal data
   that can be used to profile whole populations; regulation of state
   acquisition and deployment of biodata such as DNA, facial images, or
   voice samples; meaningful export controls on surveillance technology;
   and transparency and public audit requirements for machine-learning
   tools deployed by governments that can affect basic rights.

   Such measures, even if widely adopted, would not be a panacea. In many
   cases, they would not be legally enforceable. But they would make an
   important contribution to the development of broadly accepted
   international norms on the limits of surveillance. Those norms,
   combined with the opprobrium visited upon governments that violate
   them, are the best practical way we have to push back against the
   surveillance-state Leviathan that Beijing has built to monitor and
   control the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang.
