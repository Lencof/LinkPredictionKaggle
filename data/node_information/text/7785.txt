            services — like Chrome, Gmail, or YouTube — or benefit from
            regular upgrades and security updates.
          + Though its widely known that the tech giantʼs Android platform
            has captured a mind-blowing share of the OS market, it has

            Principal Analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider.
          + Googleʼs control over Android, coupled with the fact that itʼs
            the only viable operating system for smartphone manufacturers
            today, has left Huawei in a seemingly impossible situation
            moving forward.

       Googleʼs Android operating system (OS) may be open source, but as
       we have been reminded this week, the tech giant has complete
       control over the apps and services that make its platform so
       valuable.
       Googleʼs firm grip on the Android ecosystem was on full display
       Sunday when Reuters reported the company would revoke its Android
       license from the Chinese manufacturing-giant, Huawei. The decision
       was reportedly made to comply with President Trumpʼs order barring
       trade with certain blacklisted Chinese companies.
       In one-fell-swoop, Google was able to restrict new Huawei devices
       in markets around the world from accessing its Google Play store
       and Google Play Services. That means, as long as Trumpʼs ban
       remains, Huawei manufactured devices will be allowed to run the
       open source version of Androidʼs OS, but they wonʼt benefit from
       system-level integration with popular apps and services — like
       Chrome, Gmail, or YouTube — or from regular upgrades and security
       updates, not to mention the loss of access to Googleʼs tremendous
       app store.
       Google did say existing Huawei users would still be able to access
       the Google Play app store and its built-in malware protection. On
       Tuesday, following the US governmentʼs decision to grant Huawei a
       90-day reprieve from the blacklist, Google said it would follow
       suit as well.
       "Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyoneʼs best
       interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to
       provide software updates and security patches to existing models
       for the next 90 days," a Google spokesman told Business Insider in
       a statement.
       Despite the grace period, the impending blow could be catastrophic
       for Huaweiʼs smartphone business — which, as of earlier this month,
       was the second-largest in the world. Without access to an app store
       or services like Googleʼs Search or Maps, the options are grim.
       The company said back in March that the company was developing its
       own operating system, should sanctions be placed against them by
       the US. And on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Huawei has been in
       talks with European carriers and developers, pitching them on
       optimizing apps for the manufacturing giantʼs native platform.
       Read more: Huawei developed a ʼplan Bʼ operating system for
       smartphones in case it was banned by the US government from using
       Google products. Hereʼs what we know about it so far.
       But the likelihood of Huawei attracting developers to build
       applications for its OS — especially apps that are on the level
       that Google provides today — is unlikely, according to Carolina
       Milanesi, Principal Analyst at Creative Strategies.
       "You can build a different OS... but what are consumers going to do
       for search, for maps, for YouTube?" Milanesi told Business Insider
       in a recent interview. "All of these things have alternatives, but
       why would I do that? Itʼs not like Huaweiʼs phones are that amazing
       that I would forego all the services Iʼve been using for years."

There are actually two different Androids out there
       The situation in which Huawei finds itself shines a light on
       Googleʼs incredible power in the smartphone industry.
       Though itʼs widely known that the tech giantʼs Android platform has
       captured a mind-blowing share of the OS market — more than 85% of
       smartphones worldwide run on Android according to a recent IDC
       report — there are actually two different Androids: Thereʼs the
       official, Google version of Android that the company regularly
       updates (the latest version, Android Q, is currently in beta
       testing) and thereʼs Android Open Source Project (or, AOSP).
       Android Open Source is freely available for anyone to take, tinker
       with, and customize as they see fit.
       But if you want the version of Android that comes with all the
       latest security patches, integrated access to cutting-edge Google
       services like Assistant, and other benefits, you need to obtain a
       license from Google. (Though, it is important to note that the flow
       of Android updates is largely controlled by phone manufacturers and
       wireless carriers, who generally decide which devices get which
       patches, and when.)
       "Thereʼs a phonetics issue here," Forrester analyst Frank Gillett
       told Business Insider. "Thereʼs open-source, as in everyone can see
       the code and can contribute. And then thereʼs the — can you use it
       regardless of what Google thinks? And the answer is, no. You need
       permission from Google to use this stuff."
       Because of Androidʼs open-sourced nature, smartphones and tablets
       running the AOSP version can leave users with mixed, and sometimes
       sub-par, experiences.
       Packaging its services and restricting access to the official
       version, Gillett said, is Googleʼs way of creating more consistent
       interactions across the Android ecosystem. The introduction of
       Google Play Services in 2012 for example, allowed Google to instill
       organization and standards on one part of the Android world, while
       also ensuring that Google maintained tremendous power over the
       platform.
       "From a developers perspective, [Android] is open source," Milanesi
       said. "But Google puts a lot of extra work on it to optimize for
       its services in a way that benefits them."

Little to no options for Huawei
       In China today — where trade restrictions in the US are already in
       place — Huawei phones are running on a customized version of AOSP.
       Under the hood, itʼs all Android, but it has a proprietary look and
       feel that the company developed in-house.
       Users of those phones in China have some access to apps, like
       Gmail, but the devices lack other valuable services, like managed
       updates and security upgrades. For those users, little will change
       because of Googleʼs break with Huawei.
       But on a global market, where Huawei sells a huge amount of its
       products, Huawei phones run the Google version of Android, along
       with all the Google app consumers want, like Search, Maps, and
       Youtube. Those global consumers arenʼt going to accept a
       stripped-down experience, said Ben Bajarin, Principal Analyst at
       Creative Strategies.

       Shayanne Gal/Business Insider
       "[Huawei is] going to have to do something if this doesnʼt get
       resolved," Bajarin told Business Insider in a recent interview.
       "Theyʼre obviously not going to not sell phones. But theyʼre not
       going to have any success with a skinned version of Android."
       Should Huawei move forward with reports that itʼs going to create
       an Android alternative, history is not on its side. Samsung most
       recently tried its hand at creating its own OS — called Tizen — but
       the phones and its Linux-based platform havenʼt caught on. In a
       review of Samsungʼs Tizen, Ars Technica wrote that "it felt like a
       hollow copy of Android without any apps."
       The lack of viable options for Huawei to find (or build) an
       alternative OS have some questioning if Googleʼs Android should be
       considered a monopoly over the smartphone industry. If Google can
       cripple the second largest handset manufacturer with one, simple
       decision, than those concerns seem justified.
       Google has been subject to the recent "techlash," as politicians
       like Senator Elizabeth Warren have called for it to break off parts
       of its business that dominate industries, like Search. Regulating
       or breaking up Android, however, was not mentioned by Warren.
       Perhaps this weekʼs events will put increased pressure on Google to
       loosen its control over Android, or force other operating systems
       to ramp up their reach. In the end, though, Presidentʼs Trump
       blacklisting of Huawei could just be a bargaining chip in his
       broader trade wars with China. By next week, the order in the
       smartphone world may be restored.
       If not, things are about to get interesting.

       UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Getty
          + Prime Minister Boris Johnsonʼs opponents have called on him to
            resign following Tuesdayʼs explosive verdict of the UK Supreme
            Court that his suspension of Parliament was illegal.
          + The court ruled that Johnsonʼs decision to close down
            Parliament was null and void.
          + The opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said
            Johnson should consider his position and become the "shortest
            serving prime minister" ever.
          + Johnson has had a turbulent beginning to his premiership since
            he entered office in July. He has suffered a series of
            high-profile resignations, including that of his brother.
       The UK opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on Tuesday called
       on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to become the "shortest-serving
       prime minister" ever as Johnsonʼs opponents lined up to call for
       his resignation following the dramatic UK Supreme Court ruling that
       his decision earlier this month to suspend the UK Parliament was
       illegal.
       The explosive unanimous verdict means Johnson misled the Queen when
       he advised her to shut down Parliament. It came at the end of a
       turbulent period for Johnson, who has lost multiple votes in
       Parliament since becoming prime minister in July and suffered a
       series of resignations from his government, including that of his
       brother.

       suspension of Parliament was illegal
       Politicians representing all parts of the United Kingdom joined the
       chorus of calls for him to stand down immediately.
       Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who helped bring the case
       against Johnson, said the prime minister should now "do the decent
       thing and resign."
       "This is a huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy," she
       said outside the court in central London.
       She added: "His position is untenable and he should have the guts
       for once to the decent thing and resign."
       The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said "a prime
       minister with any honor would tender his resignation."

ʼThe final strawʼ

     —Sky News (@SkyNews) September 24, 2019
       The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, also said Johnson should
       stand down as a matter of honor.
       "Any normal Prime Minister would – as a matter of honour – tender
       their resignation after such a unanimous verdict from the UKʼs
       highest court," he tweeted.
       "It is the final straw in a pitiful episode for the country."
       The opposition Liberal Democrats called for Johnson to stand down
       and make way for a government of national unity.
       The prime minister, who was in New York meeting world leaders
       Tuesday at the UN General Assembly, did not immediately issue a
       statement about the verdict.
       He ignored questions from reporters about the issue as he entered
       the UN on Tuesday.

     —Omar Moore (@thepopcornreel) September 24, 2019
       Downing Street officials told The Guardian, however, that they
       would need to consider what they called an "extraordinary" ruling.
       Speaking with reporters on Monday, Johnson said he would not stand
       down and insisted he had suspended Parliament to set out a new
       program for government.
       Asked whether he would resign if the court ruled against him,
       Johnson replied "no," according to Politico.
       "I think the reasons for wanting a Queenʼs Speech were extremely
       good," he reportedly said.

          + Facebook said it recognized that moderation can be difficult
            but that employees "play a crucial role in helping create a
            safe environment for the Facebook community."
         ______________________________________________________________

       A former Facebook moderator said the pressure to churn through a
       never-ending pile of disturbing material eventually made her
       desensitized to child pornography and bestiality.
       Sarah Katz, 27, worked as a content reviewer at Facebookʼs
       headquarters in Menlo Park, California, through a third-party
       contractor, Vertisystem, for eight months in 2016. Her job was
       simple: figure out whether posts reported to Facebook violated the
       companyʼs detailed community standards.
       Practically, this meant eyeballing new and potentially horrific
       material every 10 seconds and making a snap decision about whether
       it needed to be ditched. Posts that needed reviewing were called
       "tickets," and there were about 8,000 every day.
       To deal with this onslaught, Facebook had 4,500 moderators like
       Katz on its books last year, and in May 2017 it announced plans to
       hire another 3,000 to help it in the fight against the darkest
       corners of its user output. Facebook is also investing in
       artificial intelligence to help police posts that break its rules.
       Facebook detailed the scale of its problem with prohibited content
       in a transparency report in May. It said that in the first three
       months of this year it "took action" on 21 million posts containing
       nudity and sexual activity and 3.4 million featuring graphic
       violence. Millions of posts with hate speech, spam, and terrorist
       content were also removed.

Reviewers have to sign a waiver document about offensive material
       Facebook waiver
       The waiver Katz signed before joining Facebook. Sarah Katz
       Content reviewers begin their Facebook journey by signing a waiver
       document, which basically acknowledges that they are braced to view
       the disturbing material. Itʼs also designed to protect Facebook
       from any potential legal action.
       The one Katz signed says moderators will be exposed to material
       that "may be offensive to some people," including pornographic
       images. It adds that staff members should "promptly notify"
       Facebook if they "do not wish to continue."
       "Facebook has billions of users, and people donʼt know how to use
       the platform correctly, so there was a lot of pornography,
       bestiality, graphic violence," Katz told Business Insider. "There
       was a lot of content that you might not expect to see shared on
       Facebook."
       Katz worked in an open-plan office in Menlo Park, where free snacks
       flowed and there was reasonable camaraderie among her colleagues.
       They would set to work on their queue of posts for review, and when
       in full flow, Katz would make decisions within seconds, she said.
       If ticket targets were not met, there would be consequences.
       Failing to hit a goal "once or twice" would result in a warning,
       Katz said; more than three times, "you would probably get let go."
       Katz said that she never witnessed this but that it was informally
       known among staff members.
       "Itʼs kind of a monotonous job after a while," she said. "You
       definitely grow desensitized to some of the graphic material
       because you see so much of it. A lot of the content tends to
       recirculate."

A sinister image that kept resurfacing
       Katz said there was a particularly sinister photo and video that
       popped up repeatedly in her queue.
       She said it featured two children between 9 and 12 years old
       standing facing each other, wearing nothing below the waist, and
       touching each other. It was clear, Katz said, that there was
       someone behind the camera telling them what to do.
       "It would go away and come back. It would appear at multiple times
       of the day," she said. "Each time the user location would be
       different — one day shared from Pakistan, another day the US. Itʼs
       kind of hard to track down the initial source."
       At the time, Katz said, she was not asked to report the accounts
       sharing the material — something she said "disturbed" her.
       "If the userʼs account was less than 30 days old, we would
       deactivate the account as a fake account," she said. "If the
       account was older than 30 days, we would simply remove the content
       and leave the account active."
       Facebook Menlo Park
       Inside Facebookʼs headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Reuters
       Her experience raises questions about the effectiveness of
       Facebookʼs efforts to tackle child exploitation on its platform.
       The company signed a deal with Microsoft in 2011 to use its
       PhotoDNA technology, designed to scan all images on Facebook and
       Instagram, flag known child porn, and prevent it from being
       reuploaded. Furthermore, Facebook moderators are trained to
       recognise and escalate such content internally when they see it.
       Facebook told the New York Post in 2012 that it reported all
       instances of child exploitation to the USʼs National Center for
       Missing and Exploited Children.
       "We have zero tolerance for child pornography being uploaded onto
       Facebook and are extremely aggressive in preventing and removing
       child exploitative content," a company spokesman said at the time.
       Katz said she was not aware that any of this was in place in 2016.
       "Facebook might have a policy [now] where youʼre supposed to report
       it, but back then they didnʼt," she said.
       Facebook declined to comment on the discrepancy between Katzʼs
       account and its stated policies.

The nuance of human perspective
       Katz is now a cybersecurity analyst for the cloud-computing firm
       ServiceNow and has written a sci-fi novel, "Apex Five," that draws
       inspiration from her time at Facebook. She is broadly upbeat about
       her Facebook experience, arguing that the downsides of the job were
       outweighed by the sense that she was protecting users.
       "There needs to be many human eyes to do the job, and it cannot all
       be allocated to artificial intelligence, no matter how much folks
       say," she said. "We will always be that nuance of human
       perspective. AI would help to track all that content from billions
       of users. The human element has to be taken care of, so we keep
       doing a good job."
       Mark Zuckerberg (Jake Kanter using for post)
       Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Reuters
       Katz urged tech firms to do more to make moderation a career rather
       than a short-term job.
       "It behooves not only Facebook but social-media platforms in
       general to hire content moderators on a full-time basis because
       provides much more incentive," she said. "It really incentivises us
       to do a stellar job and make it something we want to stick with,
       rather than winging it, holding out for something better."
       A Facebook spokeswoman said: "Our global team of content reviewers
       play a crucial role in helping create a safe environment for the
       Facebook community, which is our number one priority. We recognise
       that this work can often be difficult, so we have wellness and
       psychological support in place for all our staff.
       "Itʼs a really big job with more than 2 billion people on Facebook,
       so we recently added 3,000 people to our existing 4,500-strong
       community operations team around the world to review the millions
       of reports we get every week."

          + Morgan Stanley is cutting dozens of employees from its sales
            and trading staff as part of a year-end review, according to
            people with knowledge of the matter.
          + The bank will tell affected employees this week.
       Morgan Stanley is in the process of dismissing dozens of employees
       from its sales and trading staff.
       The cuts are being made to cull the firmʼs underperformers or
       reposition desks that may need fewer employees, according to people
       with knowledge of the matter. Itʼs part of an annual process, which
       the bank has made more rigorous in the past few years, one of the
       people said.
       The bank began alerting affected employees over the past week, as
       part of its annual promotion and compensation process, one of the
       people said. Next week, remaining employees will be told about
       their bonus figures and if they were up for a promotion — whether
       or not they got it.
       Some employees may not receive bonuses for 2018, whatʼs known in
       the industry as a doughnut or a bagel.
       A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs.
       Morgan Stanley made headlines in 2015 when it announced a surprise
       25% cut to its fixed-income-business staff, a move that ultimately
       affected almost 500 people. This yearʼs cuts are much smaller and
       arenʼt part of a similar top-down cut, but a bottoms-up evaluation
       of individual business units and their headcounts, one of the
       people said.
       The cuts, which span the fixed-income, equities, and research
       divisions, affect less than 100 people. The unit has more than
       3,500 people globally.

          + Facebookʼs first president, Sean Parker, has been sharply

         ______________________________________________________________

       Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook, has a disturbing
       warning about the social network: "God only knows what itʼs doing
       to our childrenʼs brains."
       Speaking to the news website Axios, the entrepreneur and executive
       talked openly about what he perceives as the dangers of social
       media and how it exploits human "vulnerability."
       "The thought process that went into building these applications,
       Facebook being the first of them ... was all about: ʼHow do we
       consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?ʼ"
       said Parker, who joined Facebook in 2004, when it was less than a
       year old.
       "And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine
       hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a
       photo or a post or whatever," he told Axios. "And thatʼs going to
       get you to contribute more content, and thatʼs going to get you ...
       more likes and comments."
       Parker added: "Itʼs a social-validation feedback loop ... exactly
       the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with,
       because youʼre exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology."
       "The inventors, creators — itʼs me, itʼs Mark [Zuckerberg], itʼs
       Kevin Systrom on Instagram, itʼs all of these people — understood
       this consciously," he said. "And we did it anyway."
       Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insiderʼs request
       for comment.

Some in tech are growing disillusioned — and worried
       Parker isnʼt the only tech figure to express disillusionment and
       worry by what they helped create. Tristan Harris, a former Google
       employee, has been outspoken in his criticism of how tech
       companiesʼ products hijack usersʼ minds.
       "If youʼre an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself
       into a slot machine," he wrote in a widely shared Medium post in
       2016.
       "We need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to
       be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that
       put our values, not our impulses, first," he continued. "Peopleʼs
       time is valuable. And we should protect it with the same rigor as
       privacy and other digital rights."

       In a recent feature, The Guardian spoke to tech workers and
       industry figures who have been critical of Silicon Valley business
       practices.
       Loren Brichter, the designer who created the slot-machine-like
       pull-down-to-refresh mechanism now widely used on smartphones,
       said, "Iʼve spent many hours and weeks and months and years
       thinking about whether anything Iʼve done has made a net positive
       impact on society or humanity at all."
       Brichter added: "Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is
       addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them,
       it was not something I was mature enough to think about. Iʼm not
       saying Iʼm mature now, but Iʼm a little bit more mature, and I
       regret the downsides."
       And Roger McNamee, an investor in Facebook and Google, told The
       Guardian: "The people who run Facebook and Google are good people,
       whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended
       consequences ... The problem is that there is nothing the companies
       can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current
       advertising models."
       The comments from Parker and others are further evidence of souring
       public sentiment about Silicon Valley. Once lauded in utopian
       terms, companies like Facebook have now come under heavy criticism
       over their role in the spread of "fake news" and Russian
       propaganda.
