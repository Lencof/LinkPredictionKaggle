The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations
body for assessing the science related to climate change.

The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific
assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks,
as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.

   Through its assessments, the IPCC determines the state of knowledge on
   climate change. It identifies where there is agreement in the
   scientific community on topics related to climate change, and where
   further research is needed. The reports are drafted and reviewed in
   several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.  The
   IPCC does not conduct its own research.

   IPCC reports are neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.
    The assessment reports are a key input into the international
   negotiations to tackle climate change. Created by the United Nations
   Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO) in 1988, the IPCC  has 195 Member countries. In the
   same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP
   in jointly establishing the IPCC.

Reports

   The IPCC prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of
   scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change,
   its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at
   which climate change is taking place. It also produces Special Reports
   on topics agreed to by its member governments, as well as Methodology
   Reports that provide guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas
   inventories. Learn more about the reports here.

Activities

   The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing
   the state of knowledge of climate change. These include assessment
   reports, special reports and methodology reports. To deliver this work
   programme, the IPCC holds meetings of its government representatives,
   convening as plenary sessions of the Panel or IPCC Working Groups to
   approve, adopt and accept reports. Plenary Sessions of the IPCC also
   determine the IPCC work programme, and other business including its
   budget and outlines of reports. The IPCC Bureau meets regularly to
   provide guidance to the Panel on scientific and technical aspects of
   its work.

   The IPCC organizes scoping meetings of experts and meetings of lead
   authors to prepare reports. It organizes expert meetings and workshops
   on various topics to support its work programme, and publishes the
   proceedings of these meetings.  To communicate its findings and explain
   its work, the IPCC takes part in outreach activities organized by the
   IPCC or hosted by other organizations, and provides speakers to other
   conferences.

   More information on sessions of the IPCC, its Working Groups and the
   Bureau can be found in the Documentation section.

Working Groups and Task Force

   IPCC assessments and special reports are prepared by three Working
   Groups, each looking at a different aspect of the science related to
   climate change: Working Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working
   Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability), and Working Group III
   (Mitigation of Climate Change). The IPCC also has a Task Force on
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, whose main objective is to develop
   and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national
   greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

   The Working Groups and Task Force handle the preparation of reports,
   selecting and managing the experts that work on them as authors.

   The activities of each Working Group and the Task Force are supported
   by their Technical Support Units (TSU).
