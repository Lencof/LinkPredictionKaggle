   Exposing undergraduate students to different kinds of research is a
   cause Nobel laureate Robert Grubbs cares about deeply. He intentionally
   welcomes undergraduates into his laboratory during the pivotal years
   when they begin to imagine their futures in science.

Nayla Abney

   Nayla Abney took a chance leaving New Jersey and the East Coast to come
   to Caltech. She helped launch the inaugural season for women's soccer
   at Caltech in 2017 and says the sport and the team teach lessons that
   help her in the classroom and on the field. The chemical engineering
   major is inspired by the researchers and professors on campus, and she
   is committed to building a legacy for other young women at Caltech.

   Engineers from Caltech have generated a computer simulation of
   underwater bubble rings that is so realistic it is virtually
   indistinguishable from a video of the real thing. Its developers hope
   that the simulation can shed light on the mathematics and forces that
   govern such phenomena. • See the full video and learn more about the
   research - just search “bubble rings” on Caltech.edu.

   issue of Totem, Caltech’s annual literary and visual arts magazine.
