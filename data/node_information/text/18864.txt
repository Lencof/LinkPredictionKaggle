Successes in education from the innovative and appropriate use of EdTech

   [__700x9999.Sanni-Lanni-.jpg]

   Hear from Mrs S Lani, Executive Head Teacher of a Walsall Primary
   School and Children's Centre discuss her experiences of using EdTech to
   transform teaching and learning, and what inspired her whilst attending
   Bett.

   I am Executive Head Teacher of a very large Primary School and
   Children’s Centre in Walsall.  Previous to this I ran a large Primary
   School in Wolverhampton.  My previous school was graded as
   ‘Outstanding’ on 3 consecutive occasions and my current school is now a
   ‘good school with a strong drive towards excellence’.  We are on the
   way to becoming an outstanding centre of excellence.

   At the heart of my experiences and successes in education lies the
   innovative and appropriate use of EdTech to transform learning and
   teaching.  Through the use of EdTech in my schools the learning
   experience has been transformed for thousands upon thousands of
   children who have left our care having achieved great results and
   developed lifelong skills including confidence, communication and
   resilience.  Additionally through a number of strategies including the
   use of EdTech the quality of teaching and confidence of teachers has
   been significantly improved again leading to high quality learning
   opportunities for children.

   I attended BETT for the first time this year because I was aware from
   speaking to others who had attended that there would be vast
   opportunities to hear from others how technology can improve and
   enhance learning.  The education sector is constantly evolving and I
   believed that with so many different companies and individuals
   attending I would be able to experience first hand many new
   technologies placing me in a position to talk to providers and reflect
   on what is best to further the learning of my children in my school at
   this particular time.

   Attending gave me so many opportunities which I would not have been
   able to access in any other way.  I was able to benefit from attending
   a number of seminars related to areas of specific interest to myself,
   look closely at some of the latest technologies with the potential to
   aid us in continuing to transform learning in our schools and speak
   with and pick up ideas and strategies from other educators.

   I did discover new ideas and technologies and I was able to hold follow
   up conversations where I felt it appropriate once back in school to
   look further into areas of interest.  Through networking I have been
   able to develop good working relationships with some individuals who
   now work with the school to initiate further developments and make
   economies of scale in certain areas.

   It is vital to keep up to date with technology because this is the
   world for which we need to prepare our children and by attending I was
   able to see some emerging trends in the market.

   Educational Technology can help teachers and pupils - it
   provides benefits such as organisation, efficiency, collaboration,
   resilience, communication, extra help, virtual experiences and so much
   more

   EdTech is our future and I would advise all leaders in education to
   access opportunities such as the BETT show to consider how they can
   implement relevant technology into their settings in order to enhance
   the learning experience and prepare children for life in a
   technological world.

   weeks! Make sure to stay connected and check out our social media
   channels.

What's new at Bett 2020?

   [__700x9999.2018_01_25_I2I_Bett_Day2_0791.jpg]

   The long and glorious summer may be over, and at Bett we’re delighted
   to be heading into the next four months with great anticipation for the
   2020 edition on 22-25 January at the London ExCeL.

   We’re understandably excited to share the latest event developments and
   shed some light on what you can expect when visiting our 36th edition,
   including greater networking opportunities, additional CPD hours and
   more onsite features.

   With notable shifts in the education sector, following the most recent
   announcement from the Prime Minister declaring how schools in England
   are being promised billions more in spending over the next three years,
   it’s been announced that £2.6bn will be invested in 2020-2021, £4.8bn
   in 2021-22 and £7.1bn in 2022-23.

   Further Education funding is also expected to be on the up, with
   Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid announcing that when Britain
   leaves the EU on 31 October, our government will invest a further £400
   million in education for 16-19-year olds next year. Bettering education
   is truly at the forefront of public agenda, and ours.
   Here’s what’s new at Bett 2020.

   For Bett 2020, advancing education is what we’re truly all about and in
   January, we’ll once again be a platform for 34,000+ educators and
   leaders from the UK and overseas to engage with 800+ EdTech providers,
   SMEs and start-ups, and to learn from 300+ of the most influential
   voices in the landscape.

   Read the latest news on the Education Show.

   For the first time in Bett’s history, the Education Show will be fully
   integrated inside our event and will be accessible to all within the
   North Hall. There will be hundreds of suppliers who will provide
   products that are essential to the health and wealth of education
   institutions, along with a brand-new Education Show Theatre that offers
   more CPD-led sessions with topics that cover a wider range of
   educators’ needs.
   Visitors will have better navigation than ever before.

   After listening to our 2019 feedback, we’ve been busily implementing
   changes to the floorplan which will revolutionise Bett visitor
   experiences forever. In 2020, visitors will discover six different
   solution zones inside our event, including:
     * Education Show
     * Equipment & Hardware
     * Management Solutions
     * Teaching Tech
     * Learning Tech
     * Global Showcase

   Visitors will be able to navigate their journey around the floorplan
   with ease and find the solutions or products they’re after, leading to
   better conversations and higher quality outcomes when taking the
   technology and learnings back into their schools.
   We’ll have even more content & CPD in our conference programme.

   To expand on the quality of our content, we’re introducing more
   educator-led sessions into Bett than ever before, which is key to
   ensuring that our visitors benefit from a diverse range of peer
   learnings, insights and expertise.

   We have also invested in brand new content, such as launching two
   Professional Development Theatres which offer free CPD workshops to
   educators at all levels and will address the ‘how to’ to ensure
   visitors get maximum impact from technology.

   -
   Our six new content themes to educate and inspire.

   We will have six new themes which will structure the conference
   programme, to ensure that every learner and educator from the entire
   landscape can benefit from this year’s content. They include:
     * Innovation
     * Wellbeing
     * Empowering Teaching & Learning
     * Inclusion, Social Mobility and SEND
     * Future Tech and Trends
     * Skills

   Our newly appointed Advisory Board, made up of the industries experts,
   will ensure that our content is steered in the right direction and our
   finger is firmly on the pulse when assessing the latest developments in
   the education industry. See who they are here
   We’ve got more networking opportunities.

   Bett 2020 will have more networking opportunities onsite, with a Staff
   Room for educators to have space to discuss the content sessions
   they’ve experienced and reflect upon what’s inspired them.

   On top of this, we have the Connect@Bett networking app, which will
   enable visitors to set up meetings with relevant exhibitors and fellow
   educators to help them maximise their time.

Promethean: BIGGER AND BETTER

   [__700x9999.promethean1.jpg]

   THE BACKGROUND

   Promethean has been exhibiting at Bett for 20 years now. But in 2019,
   Promethean wanted to go one step further, and make the four days of
   Bett the true highlight of their year – reaching and meeting every
   stakeholder, partner and customer at the show, as well as attracting
   new ones. Here’s how they did it.

   THE CHALLENGE

   To make Bett the big event of the year, the main challenge was to make
   sure the right stakeholders turned up, and most importantly found their
   way to the Promethean stand. This required an original, vibrant and
   expanded physical presence at the show – not just in size but in
   substance too. Plus, Promethean is a global brand with a far-flung
   customer base, so a key business objective was to gain more
   international customers. With 44% of Bett’s visitor base attending the
   show from overseas, bringing them to the stand was a key focus.

   “Since first exhibiting at Bett around 20 years ago, we’ve built on our
   presence year-on-year – every time striving to deliver a bigger and
   better experience for our customers, prospects and partners. As a
   global education company, Bett is an international stage where we can
   strategically position our offering and provide an important focal
   point for all of our activities across the world.”

   - Ian Curtis, Head of EMEA & APAC Markets

   Promethean-1.png

   THE SOLUTION

   Promethean achieved these objectives by bringing its full marketing
   firepower to Bett – and they designed a stand to match. Two separate
   branded stands faced each other over an aisle, with Platinum Suite
   sponsorship allowing all stakeholders to gather under one roof (or
   two!) Once this expanded stand presence had attracted the visitors,
   on-stand creative activities kept them there. The #ClassroomStory
   campaign featured educators talking about what inspires them in their
   profession, while one of the participating teachers in the Grandmaster
   Challenge showcased how Promethean solutions can enhance learning. All
   this took serious work starting a matter of weeks after the previous
   year’s show; Promethean’s international field marketing team led the
   planning and delivery of the brand’s presence at Bett, with substantial
   support from other functions.

   THE RESULTS

   This turbo-charged Bett presence delivered results against every
   performance metric, meeting all the pre-show objectives. The expanded
   stand presence delivered strong return on investment, with a 30%
   increase in footfall to the Promethean stand across the event.
   International visitor traffic was also up – the first day alone saw
   more overseas visitors than the whole of the previous year’s event.
   They represented 32 countries in total, giving Promethean a truly
   global reach and delivering on a vital pre-show goal. All in all, 11
   months of preparation was time well spent.

   The lesson? When it comes to Bett, you get out what you put in.

   “As a manufacturer who sells through distribution partners, Bett is the
   ideal opportunity to engage directly with teachers, school leaders and
   ICT managers. We’re able to showcase our offering to a captive audience
   and then often signpost these to some of our key reseller partners who
   also exhibit at the show. This dovetail approach has consistently
   proven an effective sales and marketing strategy.”

   - Alistair Hayward, Head of UKI & ANZ Markets

   Why do these educational figures come to Bett?

   “Bett provides a hub to connect together like-minded and engaged
   educators around technology,” says Jon Audin of the University of
   Winchester. “Once a year, everything that you need around the field of
   EdTech and its use can be found under one roof. With talks, teachers,
   students and companies sharing the latest practise and ideas it
   encourages the searching questions of whether this technology will make
   a difference to students we teach.”

   As technology plays a wider role in improving education, teaching and
   student outcomes, Bett continues to play a big role in bridging the gap
   between educators and tech suppliers.

   “My trips to BETT are always to feel the buzz of being connected to
   likeminded people in tech,” National Community Manager at Computing at
   School Beverly Clarke says. “Each trip I have a few known suppliers
   which I aim to see and then I go along to the thought provoking talks
   which are taking place.”

   While technology is a key focus of Bett, collaboration and knowledge
   sharing is also at the core of what the show offers. It makes for the
   perfect platform for showcasing and sharing best practices and the
   latest developments in education, as Alison Clarke Wilson of UCL says:
   “I have been coming to Bett since about 1996 – and what draws me back
   is both the opportunity to share the work I am doing more widely - and
   to learn from others doing the same.”

   Technology’s educational impact

   “Technology in education gives every child a voice, the use of devices
   combined with intuitive software and an interactive board enables a
   teacher to move freely around the classroom, interacting with pupils,”
   says Stella McCarthy, Computing Coordinator at Benhurst Primary
   School.

   In 2020, Bett will be exploring six big themes, and EdTech plays an
   exceptional role in defining each of them. The themes are:

   - - -

Innovation

Wellbeing

Empowering Teaching & Learning

   - - -

Inclusion, Social Mobility & SEND

Future Tech & Trends

Skills


   “Technology helps to bridge gaps with social mobility,” explains
   Beverly Clarke.  “Once students have use of tech, they can see endless
   possibilities and reach out beyond their immediate environments”

   Educationalist Karine George adds: “The opportunity to break free from
   the confines of the classroom so that students can work not just
   locally but nationally and globally.

   “Against this background we can make learning real and relevant,
   bringing world issues to the table for discussion. In this way, with
   different experiences and backgrounds, we have more chance of creating
   global citizens who together will have more chance of solving some of
   the world’s problems more creatively, whilst developing a global
   tolerance and understanding for the many different points of view.”

   Bett will be exploring the above themes, and the interplay between
   learning, teaching and technology this year, across nine theatres in
   both North and South Halls, and its upcoming must-attend edition. 180
   hours of content is waiting at Bett 2020.

   The 2020 Theatres Include:
     * Professional Development Theatre (North and South Hall)
     * The Staff Room
     * Bett Arena
     * Education Show Theatre
     * Higher & Further Education Theatre
     * Tech in Action (North and South Hall)
     * Schools Theatre

   The Education Show will be held inside of Bett 2020 too this year,
   adding further content, speakers and events to enjoy.

   Pedagogy is explored at Bett, as Stella McCarthy enthuses: “There are
   many inspirational, motivational talks which take place in the main
   arena.  Meet like minded educators at peer to peer sessions and have in
   depth discussions around pedagogy.  Some exhibitors have teachers and
   student digital leaders on their stands, who you can meet to discuss
   how the technology is used in their schools.”

   To hear more from Bett’s Advisory Board, keep an eye out for more
   articles in the coming weeks that will discuss the latest themes,
   topics and innovation that are at core of Bett 2020.

The Themes Powering Bett 2020

   [__700x9999.Bett_Speakers_2019_163-(1).jpg]

   The Themes Powering Bett 2020

   As the industry leading educational technology event, Bett is committed
   to exploring the big issues that are affecting all education sectors in
   the 21st century. It’s where the educators come to get educated,
   inspired and connected to collectively transform education technology.

   In 2020, we’re pleased to announce our exclusive show agenda will be
   structured by six major themes that surface prominently within the
   industry. We’ll be exploring all facets of each topic in-depth, with a
   variety of practical sessions and workshops across 180 hours of event
   content in nine on-site theatres.

   Bett_Speakers_2019_041.jpg

   Introducing Bett 2020’s Content Themes

Innovation

   Innovation waits for no one, and educators are no different.

   Smart solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing teaching at
   all ages will be showcased at Bett, from pre-school to university
   level.

   As well as solution producers, we have scheduled in hands-on sessions
   with teachers using said technology, to highlight how the latest
   technologies are making a real impact in the classroom.

   But teaching isn’t all about technology. We will also be providing
   educators across all levels the opportunity to showcase how they are
   adapting their pedagogy to harness new ways of teaching and bring a
   fresh take on education.

Wellbeing

   Mental and physical health of students and teachers alike is a hot
   topic in contemporary education.

   So how can Bett help? Firstly, we’ll be offering case studies of
   succesful initiatives to enhance in-school wellbeing for both teachers
   and students.

   As well as the overall picture, a focus will be applied to both target
   groups, including students’ mental health and resilience, as well as
   case studies on how to lower teacher workloads – incredibly important
   subjects in the current climate.

Empowering Teaching & Learning

   With all the technology and solutions on show, it’s important to
   reflect on the education that’s at the core of Bett.

   In 2020, it’s all about empowering educators with the tools and
   knowledge they need to take teaching to the next level.

   Everything will be up for discussion, including ways to enact
   organisational change, research-sharing and collaboration, and best
   practice on how technology can make the most impact -  because
   technology isn’t here to hinder teaching – it’s here to enhance it.

Inclusion, Social Mobility & SEND

   Inclusivity and accessibility. Two key words for education.

   Technology plays a big role in ensuring all sorts of students from all
   walks of life have access to the tools they need to learn, live and
   thrive.

   Inclusivity and social mobility are at the heart of Bett. That’s why
   we’re proud to focus in on this vital educational aspect.

   What do we have in store? A wide-ranging series of events, covering
   remote learning for students in rural areas, to how educators can
   engage with the socially and economically disadvantaged with education
   to amplify their student voice.

   SEND also retains its own focus too as part of the wider inclusion and
   social mobility theme. Empowering this sector to boost their skills,
   confidence, and future employment prospects is a big responsibility.
   Bett will be on hand to discuss how teachers can do exactly that.

Future Tech & Trends

   What is the future of education? That’s what you’re going to find out.

   Bett is where the EdTech community demonstrates exciting new ideas, and
   where educators can feedback exactly what they want from the next
   generation of teaching aides and educational tech.

    The big picture for education will be painted at Bett 2020, so you can
   see how the sector will evolve in the coming years, and how technology
   will play a key role in future teaching practices.

   It’s important to think of the future, but keep an eye on the present
   too. Be at Bett to find better use of existing hardware and software
   and discover new applications for current technologies.

Skills

   What is education if not the teaching of vital skills? Everybody can
   benefit from learning something new, or build on their existing
   knowledge, and at Bett 2020 you can do just that.

   CPD is a big focus for Bett next year, with practical workshops in a
   dedicated CPD theatre we have more available hours for educators. We’ll
   be advising teachers of all experience, levels and year groups to help
   them reach their potential.

   Students also benefit from Bett, with a series of events, talks and
   sessions focussed on preparing them for the world of work, via T levels
   and apprenticeships.

   Skills should be built for life. This includes re-education of current
   workforce, including working on not just practical skills, but
   character, resilience and creativity too.
