The last CITES

   Posted on 02/10/2019 by johnray

   With a bit of luck this will be the last time I have to fill out CITES
   paperwork. Musical instruments will be exempt from CITES II and III
   controls starting soon. These two years of having to comply has been an
   added hassle that we just don’t need so we are quite happy about it.
   From now on it will just be articles in Appendix I that will be
   problematic. I have always tried to avoid restricted wood so I will say
   good-bye to CITES forever.

Where to see a guitar show in Granada

   Posted on 28/09/2019 by johnray

   Marcus Toscano is back with his daily spanish guitar concerts. So many
   people come to Granada and want to hear some guitar music but find that
   there is nothing available. Don’t miss this.

Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg

   Posted on 22/09/2019 by johnray

   My friend Knud Sindt, lute-maker, brought some students of this
   university and their teacher by the workshop on Friday for a peek into
   the world of Granada guitar-making. These soon-to-be music teachers had
   plenty of questions and enjoyed the sound of one of my Torres
   Invencible copies. The teacher Axel and a few of the students are
   guitarists and put the guitar through its paces. This guitar is a copy
   of La Invencible which I think I will keep on hand to show to potential
   customers as it has an incredible similarity to the original Torres
   guitars in its deep, deep basses and warm trebles. As always I copied
   this guitar directly from the original. This Torres is very special and
   one of the reasons is the bracing. In the photo of the original you can
   see how two of the fan braces extend into the upper bout by way of
   cut-outs in the lower transverse bar.

José Ángel Chacón

   Posted on 08/09/2019 by johnray

   I dropped in on José Ángel Chacón Tenllado yesterday in Málaga. He was
   my first teacher in this fascinating world of instrument-making. He is
   also responsible for the beginnings of artisans such as Susana Martín,
   Victor Quintanilla and his son José Ángel “Chico” Chacón Escobar. I
   caught Chico at the family workshop where he teaches lutherie and saw
   some old friends too. Always a pleasure to remember my roots.

Centro de Referencia Nacional

   Posted on 02/09/2019 by johnray

   We have been hearing for years now that Granada will be home to the
   National Centre of Reference for guitar-making. However, bureaucracy
   and bad management conspired to make that impossible. In the end
   Granada has finally been approved as reference centre for construction
   and maintenance of musical instruments among other things. There is no
   guitar programme as yet but perhaps another 10 years will see that.

A guitar for Segovia

   Posted on 23/06/2017 by johnray

   cd I am lucky enough to have as my friends and/or clients some of the
   great spanish guitarists and teachers. I met Javier Somoza while I was
   working with the 1924 Santos Hernández guitar for my article in Roseta
   published last year as he was executive editor for that issue. We
   finally got to have a drink and a meal together at the Madrid
   presentation of the journal. He played two pieces on the original
   guitar at that time and told me that he had plans to record this cd.
   The guitar is an excellent example of perhaps the best maker Spain has
   ever produced and the recording certainly does it justice. The music is
   well-chosen and very well played.

   I am pleased to see that the cd (available starting today!) has
   excellent distribution and can be bought in most european countries. I
   am not sure if Brilliant has U.S. distribution but I am betting that
   they do. In searching for these links I see that in some countries it
   will be July 7th before the cd is available.

   online shop

   France

   HMV

   FNAC

   Of course I need to mention that I have included a copy of this guitar
   in my catalogue and it is selling very well. RAY_Hernandez_03

The last CITES

   Posted on 02/10/2019 by johnray

   With a bit of luck this will be the last time I have to fill out CITES
   paperwork. Musical instruments will be exempt from CITES II and III
   controls starting soon. These two years of having to comply has been an
   added hassle that we just don’t need so we are quite happy about it.
   From now on it will just be articles in Appendix I that will be
   problematic. I have always tried to avoid restricted wood so I will say
   good-bye to CITES forever.

Where to see a guitar show in Granada

   Posted on 28/09/2019 by johnray

   Marcus Toscano is back with his daily spanish guitar concerts. So many
   people come to Granada and want to hear some guitar music but find that
   there is nothing available. Don’t miss this.

Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg

   Posted on 22/09/2019 by johnray

   My friend Knud Sindt, lute-maker, brought some students of this
   university and their teacher by the workshop on Friday for a peek into
   the world of Granada guitar-making. These soon-to-be music teachers had
   plenty of questions and enjoyed the sound of one of my Torres
   Invencible copies. The teacher Axel and a few of the students are
   guitarists and put the guitar through its paces. This guitar is a copy
   of La Invencible which I think I will keep on hand to show to potential
   customers as it has an incredible similarity to the original Torres
   guitars in its deep, deep basses and warm trebles. As always I copied
   this guitar directly from the original. This Torres is very special and
   one of the reasons is the bracing. In the photo of the original you can
   see how two of the fan braces extend into the upper bout by way of
   cut-outs in the lower transverse bar.

José Ángel Chacón

   Posted on 08/09/2019 by johnray

   I dropped in on José Ángel Chacón Tenllado yesterday in Málaga. He was
   my first teacher in this fascinating world of instrument-making. He is
   also responsible for the beginnings of artisans such as Susana Martín,
   Victor Quintanilla and his son José Ángel “Chico” Chacón Escobar. I
   caught Chico at the family workshop where he teaches lutherie and saw
   some old friends too. Always a pleasure to remember my roots.

Centro de Referencia Nacional

   Posted on 02/09/2019 by johnray

   We have been hearing for years now that Granada will be home to the
   National Centre of Reference for guitar-making. However, bureaucracy
   and bad management conspired to make that impossible. In the end
   Granada has finally been approved as reference centre for construction
   and maintenance of musical instruments among other things. There is no
   guitar programme as yet but perhaps another 10 years will see that.

A guitar for Segovia

   Posted on 23/06/2017 by johnray

   cd I am lucky enough to have as my friends and/or clients some of the
   great spanish guitarists and teachers. I met Javier Somoza while I was
   working with the 1924 Santos Hernández guitar for my article in Roseta
   published last year as he was executive editor for that issue. We
   finally got to have a drink and a meal together at the Madrid
   presentation of the journal. He played two pieces on the original
   guitar at that time and told me that he had plans to record this cd.
   The guitar is an excellent example of perhaps the best maker Spain has
   ever produced and the recording certainly does it justice. The music is
   well-chosen and very well played.

   I am pleased to see that the cd (available starting today!) has
   excellent distribution and can be bought in most european countries. I
   am not sure if Brilliant has U.S. distribution but I am betting that
   they do. In searching for these links I see that in some countries it
   will be July 7th before the cd is available.

   France

   HMV

   FNAC

   Of course I need to mention that I have included a copy of this guitar
   in my catalogue and it is selling very well. RAY_Hernandez_03
