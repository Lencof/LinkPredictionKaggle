Data in the Criteo Engine: Introduction
         ______________________________________________________________

       Alexandra Bannerman, Product Marketing Manager, explains how the
       Criteo Engine uses data to optimize your ads.
       The Criteo Engine powers all Criteo products with advanced machine
       learning, which continuously adapts and improves using a wealth of
       real-time data from the Criteo Shopper Graph:
       Identity and Interest data comes from all the shoppers connected to
       Criteo – that’s 72% of all online shoppers globally;
       Measurement data tracks every sale that occurs from a brand-funded
       retail campaign;
       Publisher interaction data is based on Criteo’s granular visibility
       of shopper interaction with websites and apps.
       Criteo has the world’s largest open shopper data set, which means
       our machine learning technology has all the detailed information
       required to precisely predict what inspires shoppers and drive
       higher engagement.

Using identity and interest data to determine shopper intent
         ______________________________________________________________

       Let’s see how Identity and Interest data informs the Criteo Engine
       on shopper behavior.
       Instead of taking a snapshot of information at the point of serving
       an ad, the Criteo Engine uses historical and real-time data to
       aggregate individual shopper activity, online and offline, over
       moving time windows – evaluating the intensity of shopper intent at
       any given time.
        Read More
     *

How the Criteo Engine predicts shopper behavior
         ______________________________________________________________

       When a shopper browses online, the Criteo Engine utilizes over 120
       shopping signals to work out, at that moment, the shopper’s
       propensity to engage, which specific products to recommend, and
       also what ad design they’ll best respond to.
       Because the Criteo Engine calculates this in real-time, and on an
       individual shopper level rather than for broad audience segments,
       the resulting ad impression is perfectly optimized for the shopper
       at that specific point along their shopping journey.
        Read More
     *

Identity and interest data in action
         ______________________________________________________________

       Here’s a quick example showing how the Criteo Engine uses identity
       and interest data to determine shopper intent and predict shopper
       behavior.
       Identity and interest data from the Criteo Shopper Graph might
       inform the Engine that ‘Shopper A’ has looked at a hat and a dress
       on your website over a 30-day period, ‘Shopper B’ has looked at ten
       hats in just seven days, and ‘Shopper C’ has looked at three hats
       on your website and purchased one in-store within seven days.
       The Criteo Engine’s machine learning algorithms are able to use
       this information, as well as conversion data trends, to predict
       that ‘Shopper B’ is most likely to convert at this point, and that
       a specific hat is the best one to recommend to them.
       While this is a basic example, real-world situations are
       considerably more complex, with the Criteo Engine taking into
       account those 120+ shopping signals every time.

Protecting shopper privacy
         ______________________________________________________________

       Remember, the privacy of shoppers is protected at all times; Criteo
       is able to assign a randomly generated ID to each shopper, across
       devices and offline, using only pseudonymous user data, and
       directly identifying information is never willingly captured.
        Read More
     *

More about shopper privacy & GDPR
         ______________________________________________________________

       Criteo adheres to regulations around the world to ensure that the
       privacy of shoppers is protected at all times.
       We are able to assign randomly generated IDs to each shopper across
       devices and offline, using technologies that rely only on
       pseudonymous user data in order to preserve shopper
       identity/privacy. This pseudonymous data preserves the privacy of
       shoppers, but still provides a rich understanding of shopping
       intent.
       We follow industry best practices to secure the data that we
       collect, are compliant with regulations that determine how consumer
       data is retained, and ensure compliance is adhered to globally with
       our technologies.
       Criteo also remains a leader in clearly stating the rights that
       consumers have to access their data, what data is collected, how it
       is used, and how they can opt-out.

       GDPR
       Criteo is fully compliant with the European Union’s General Data
       Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into effect on May 25,
       2018.
       The regulation applies to the processing of personal data collected
       in the EU, even if it is processed by companies that are located
       outside of Europe.

Evaluating ad inventory with publisher interaction data
         ______________________________________________________________

       Publisher interaction data helps the Criteo Engine find the best
       opportunities to show your ads.
       By processing billions of data points daily from thousands of
       premium publishers connected to Criteo, our Engine evaluates the
       performance of different types of publishers and ad inventory,
       based on shopper interactions with them.
       For example, shoppers will interact differently with a 600x160px
       top-of-page ad unit than they would with a 300x250px ad unit midway
       down the page – and this performance also varies depending on the
       website in question.
       These insights help the Criteo Engine determine inventory value for
       each impression, and bid accordingly to reach the right shoppers.

Data in the Criteo Engine: Real world example
         ______________________________________________________________

       Here’s an example which ties together the ways in which the Criteo
       Engine uses data.
       Christina has been looking at your products, both online and
       offline. Now, she’s browsing various publisher web sites.
       – Identity data from the Criteo Shopper Graph tells the Engine that
       this particular shopper has been shopping across various devices,
       and in-store;
       – Predictive Bidding, a feature of the Criteo Engine, utilizes
       Interest data from the Shopper Graph to determine the shopper value
       depending on how likely she is to engage and buy, and how much
       she’ll spend;
       – Predictive Bidding then uses that shopper valuation, plus
       publisher and inventory performance data, to select the most
       suitable available ad unit on a suitable website and place an
       optimal real-time bid;
       – The Engine’s Product Recommendations technology uses her shopping
       preferences as well as those of similar shoppers to determine which
       items from your product feed to show her,
       – And the Engine’s Kinetic Design technology takes into account the
       visual preferences Christina has shown previously, chooses the best
       ad design to create, and renders the ad to fit the chosen
       inventory.
       All this happens in real-time to serve Christina the best possible
       ad for products she’s likely to convert for in that moment!
       So there you have it – that’s how the Criteo Engine uses data to
       optimize your ads.
