   Get ready to re-enter the Matrix.

   Lana Wachowski is set to write and direct a fourth film set in the
   world of “The Matrix,” with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising
   their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively.

   Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures will produce and
   globally distribute the film. Warner Bros. Picture Group chairman Toby
   Emmerich made the announcement on Tuesday.

   “We could not be more excited to be re-entering ‘The Matrix’ with
   Lana,” said Emmerich. “Lana is a true visionary — a singular and
   original creative filmmaker — and we are thrilled that she is writing,
   directing and producing this new chapter in ‘The Matrix’ universe.”

   In addition to Wachowski, the script was also written by Aleksandar
   Hemon and David Mitchell. Wachowski is also producing with Grant Hill.
   Sources say the film is eyed to begin production at the top of 2020.

(EXCLUSIVE)

   Warner Bros. has been trying for the last of couple years to find a way
   to get back into “The Matrix” universe, but a hold-up over producing
   rights slowed the project down. Over the past couple of months, the
   studio saw an opportunity to ramp up development, with Reeves boasting
   a strong summer that included box office hits “John Wick 3” and “Toy
   Story 4” and a script from Wachowski that drummed up excitement.

   Plot details are currently unknown, as is how the role of Morpheus will
   be handled, originally played by Laurence Fishburne. Some sources say
   the role may be recast for a younger take.

   The three previous films —“The Matrix,” “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The
   Matrix Revolutions” — have collectively earned more than $1.6 billion
   at the global box office. All three were written and directed by Lana
   and her sister, Lilly, and starred Reeves and Moss.

   “Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality
   are even more relevant now. I’m very happy to have these characters
   back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my
   brilliant friends,” Wachowski said.

   The first “Matrix” had its 20th anniversary this year, marked by
   special screenings at select AMC locations starting on Aug. 30.

   Wachowski is represented by WME, Circle of Confusion and attorney Peter
   Grossman. Reeves is represented by WME and Ziffren Brittenham. Moss is
   represented by WME, longtime manager Elizabeth Hodgson and attorney Bob
   Lange.

   Disney’s Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have hit an impasse on new
   financing terms for upcoming Spider-Man movies, sources have told
   Variety.

   If a deal cannot be reached, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige will
   not produce future Spider-Man films, effectively removing Tom Holland’s
   Spider-Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

   Reps for Disney, Marvel and Sony had no comment. The dispute stems from
   Disney’s demand that future Spider-Man films would be financed on a
   50/50 basis with Feige remaining in a consulting producer capacity.
   Sony is believed to have proposed keeping the arrangement under the
   current terms, which stipulate that Marvel receives about 5% of
   first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenues.

   One source said that a deal might still be reached between Disney and
   Sony but there are no talks currently going on. Disney is believed to
   have expressed concerns that Feige was spread too thin due to other
   Marvel projects plus original projects for Disney Plus.

Coming Soon: Inside the Battle to Find the Right Movie Release Date

'Frozen II's' Jonathan Groff on Coming Back as Kristoff

   “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” produced by Feige and Amy Pascal, recently
   surpassed “Skyfall” to become Sony Pictures’ highest worldwide box
   office grosser.

   Feige achieved his first full producer credits more than a decade ago
   on “Iron Man” and “The Incredible Hulk.” His films have a combined
   worldwide box office gross of over $26.8 billion, and he received a
   nomination for the Academy Award for best picture for producing “Black
   Panther” this year, marking the first superhero film ever to receive a
   best picture nomination.

   Feige also produced “Avengers: Endgame,” which surpassed “Avatar” this
   summer as the highest-grossing film of all time.

   In 2015, Disney, Marvel and Sony announced a deal to share the
   Spider-Man film rights, which led to Holland portraying a younger
   version of Spider-Man in  “Captain America: Civil War,” “Spider-Man:
   Homecoming,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Avengers: Endgame” and
   “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” Sony distributed the films in which
   Spider-Man was the main character while Disney handled the other
   titles.

   Sony is widely believed to be developing two more Spider-Man movies
   with Holland reprising his role as the webslinger but has not
   officially announced those titles. The news about the impasse was first
   reported by Deadline.

When Could Taylor Swift Re-Record Her Big Machine Songs? It’s Complicated

   Florida, USA - 18 Aug 2018

   Her few words echoed around the world within minutes: Asked in a
   preview of her forthcoming “CBS This Morning” interview whether she
   might re-record her master recordings from her Big Machine, which are
   now owned and controlled by her nemesis, Justin Bieber manager Scooter
   Braun, Taylor Swift said, “Oh yeah.”

   Asked whether she plans to: “Oh, absolutely.”

   No further details were provided, but the remarks open up a plethora of
   legal questions about when and how Swift could re-record her catalog,
   and thus snatch income from Big Machine by making sure that her new
   versions, and not the ones owned by her former label, are the ones
   played by fans and used in any number of commercial ventures, such as
   advertisements, TV shows, movies, games and other uses.

   [UPDATE: After this article published, Swift revealed on “Good Morning
   America” Thursday that her contract with Big Machine allows her to
   re-record songs from her first five albums beginning in November of
   next year. “My contract says starting from November 2020 I can start
   re-recording albums 1-5,” she said.”]

VMA 2019 Fashion Moments: From Taylor Swift to Lizzo to Lil Nas X

   Prince and Def Leppard are two artists who successfully went that route
   in the past when they felt they were being unfairly compensated by
   their original labels, but their contracts dated back to the 1970s.
   Record companies quickly got wise to the practice and wrote provisions
   into their standard contracts setting a time period — typically two
   years after an album’s terms expire or five years after the release of
   the recording — before those same songs, which include live versions,
   could be released.

   Without direct knowledge of Swift’s contract, unnamed sources are
   batting around both sides of the coin. On one side, the assertion that
   Swift would be unable to re-record songs from her catalog until five
   years from 2018, when her deal with Big Machine officially expired, and
   even then the process would be prohibitively complicated. For example,
   she may not have access to the album’s original artwork or even the
   names of the songs.

   On the flip side, an insider tells Variety that Swift believes she can
   re-record her classics and that a smart lawyer — Swift’s is Donald
   Passman, one of the top attorneys in the industry and the man who
   literally wrote the book on the music industry — would not allow a
   severe re-record restriction in their artist’s contract. This source
   suggests that any album more than five years old is fair game.

   Laurie Soriano, a top music industry attorney and partner in the firm
   King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano, who has no involvement in the Swift
   contract, says she doesn’t see any reason why Swift couldn’t move ahead
   with new versions of her songs and points to the practice by legacy
   artists to do the same. Once an artist’s deal with their label expires,
   that artist has “a contractural right to record for a new label and for
   [both entities] to make money off those recordings,” she tells Variety.
   “Standard language is two years after the end of the term or five years
   after the release of the recording in question.”

   However, some contracts do have what is called an original production
   or “sound alike” clause, which prohibits a newly recorded version from
   being too similar to the original — if that’s the case with her
   contract, a Swift-sung reggaeton version of “Mean” or a heavy metal
   take on “Love Story” could have moved closer to reality. But Soriano
   says it’s “an unusual provision” for a label to make seeing as interest
   in the catalogs often spurs consumption of both the original and new
   versions.

   To be sure, Swift has made her fans more than aware of her feelings
   about Braun’s acquisition of her masters, and it’s likely that a large
   percentage of them will follow her to whichever versions of her songs
   she asks them to. Then again, others may prefer the original. Any such
   confusion may ultimately have an adverse effect on perception of the
   worth of the Big Machine catalog, potentially devaluing the assets.

   On the other hand, that’s a question of the future. Right now, rights
   to master recording are seen as incredibly valuable one-of-a-kind works
   of art, not unlike that of a famous painter. If Braun were to sell
   today, at multiples of 22x to 25x, he’d be looking at a $1 billion
   valuation for a company he and backers Carlyle Group spent $300 million
   to buy.

   If Swift’s battle history is any indication, this one is far from over…

   Johnny Flynn Stardust

   Salon Pictures has unveiled a first look image of Johnny Flynn as David
   Bowie in its upcoming feature “Stardust.”

   Rising star Flynn, who recently starred in Michael Pearce’s
   BAFTA-winning debut feature “Beast” and co-starred in the ITV and
   Amazon Studio’s adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s “Vanity
   Fair,” stars as the music icon as he embarks on his first road trip to
   America in 1971 and creates his, now legendary, Ziggy Stardust persona.
   Jena Malone co-stars as Bowie’s wife Angie alongside Marc Maron as
   publicist Rob Oberman.

   The project has been described as a “origins story” and “moment in time
   film” rather than a biopic by its producers, who likened it to British
   features “Control” and “Nowhere Boy,” about Joy Division and John
   Lennon, respectively. As such it is not reliant on using Bowie’s music
   but will instead use period music songs that the musician covered, not
   his original tracks.

   The film was first announced in January and drew criticism at the time
   from Bowie’s son Duncan Jones, who said on Twitter that no music rights
   had been granted and the project did not have the family’s blessing.

   “Stardust” is directed by Gabriel Range and written by Christopher
   Bell. It is produced by Paul Van Carter and Nick Taussig for Salon. The
   film is co-financed by Christopher Figg of Piccadilly Pictures. Fabien
   Westerhoff’s Film Constellation is handling worldwide rights.

   Ryan Murphy Walk of Fame
   CREDIT: David Buchan/Variety/REX/Shutter

   At the Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, Ryan Murphy revealed that he has 10
   greenlit projects in the pipeline at Netflix, including three
   documentaries, four TV shows, and three movies.

   Murphy has previously announced five titles slated for a Netflix
   release. Three are shows, including “Ratched,” the drama series
   starring Sarah Paulson as the infamous Nurse Ratched; “The Politician,”
   a political satire featuring Ben Platt; and “Hollywood,” which focuses
   on the golden age of Tinseltown.

   He has also announced two Netflix film adaptations of Broadway
   productions. The first is “The Prom,” set for a September 2020 debut,
   and the other is “The Boys in the Band” with Jim Parsons and Zachary
   Quinto, also due out in 2020.

   Netflix said they could not provide further information about Murphy’s
   work at this time.

   The multi-hyphenate appeared on the Time 100 stage with Janet Mock, who
   writes and produces for “Pose,” the FX series Murphy co-created about
   1980s ball culture in New York City. Murphy spoke more about his record
   Netflix deal, reported to be in the $250-$300 million range. The
   five-year pact, under which Murphy will produce content exclusively for
   Netflix, began July 1, 2018, when his deal with 20th Century Fox TV
   expired.

   Murphy said signing with Netflix was both the “hardest thing I’ve ever
   done and the easiest thing I’ve ever done,” as the company gave him the
   freedom to create what he wanted and a platform to showcase new, young
   voices.

   “I was able to say what I felt my worth was, and it was met. And I was
   astonished,” Murphy said. “It was a great moment for me. I didn’t feel
   like the picked-on kid anymore.”

   When speaking on creating content in the current era, Murphy said, “If
   you’re not writing about women or gender or race, you’re not writing.”

   He added that “there aren’t any obstacles anymore” when it comes to
   progress in Hollywood and his focus is on championing more people that
   need to be heard. Although Mock said there should be diversity behind
   the camera, she noted the fact that three of the most powerful TV
   scribes are Murphy and Greg Berlanti — two gay men — and Shonda Rhimes,
   as a sign that the industry is heading in right direction.

   Get ready to re-enter the Matrix.

   Lana Wachowski is set to write and direct a fourth film set in the
   world of “The Matrix,” with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising
   their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively.

   Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures will produce and
   globally distribute the film. Warner Bros. Picture Group chairman Toby
   Emmerich made the announcement on Tuesday.

   “We could not be more excited to be re-entering ‘The Matrix’ with
   Lana,” said Emmerich. “Lana is a true visionary — a singular and
   original creative filmmaker — and we are thrilled that she is writing,
   directing and producing this new chapter in ‘The Matrix’ universe.”

   In addition to Wachowski, the script was also written by Aleksandar
   Hemon and David Mitchell. Wachowski is also producing with Grant Hill.
   Sources say the film is eyed to begin production at the top of 2020.

(EXCLUSIVE)

   Warner Bros. has been trying for the last of couple years to find a way
   to get back into “The Matrix” universe, but a hold-up over producing
   rights slowed the project down. Over the past couple of months, the
   studio saw an opportunity to ramp up development, with Reeves boasting
   a strong summer that included box office hits “John Wick 3” and “Toy
   Story 4” and a script from Wachowski that drummed up excitement.

   Plot details are currently unknown, as is how the role of Morpheus will
   be handled, originally played by Laurence Fishburne. Some sources say
   the role may be recast for a younger take.

   The three previous films —“The Matrix,” “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The
   Matrix Revolutions” — have collectively earned more than $1.6 billion
   at the global box office. All three were written and directed by Lana
   and her sister, Lilly, and starred Reeves and Moss.

   “Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality
   are even more relevant now. I’m very happy to have these characters
   back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my
   brilliant friends,” Wachowski said.

   The first “Matrix” had its 20th anniversary this year, marked by
   special screenings at select AMC locations starting on Aug. 30.

   Wachowski is represented by WME, Circle of Confusion and attorney Peter
   Grossman. Reeves is represented by WME and Ziffren Brittenham. Moss is
   represented by WME, longtime manager Elizabeth Hodgson and attorney Bob
   Lange.

   Disney’s Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have hit an impasse on new
   financing terms for upcoming Spider-Man movies, sources have told
   Variety.

   If a deal cannot be reached, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige will
   not produce future Spider-Man films, effectively removing Tom Holland’s
   Spider-Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

   Reps for Disney, Marvel and Sony had no comment. The dispute stems from
   Disney’s demand that future Spider-Man films would be financed on a
   50/50 basis with Feige remaining in a consulting producer capacity.
   Sony is believed to have proposed keeping the arrangement under the
   current terms, which stipulate that Marvel receives about 5% of
   first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenues.

   One source said that a deal might still be reached between Disney and
   Sony but there are no talks currently going on. Disney is believed to
   have expressed concerns that Feige was spread too thin due to other
   Marvel projects plus original projects for Disney Plus.

Coming Soon: Inside the Battle to Find the Right Movie Release Date

'Frozen II's' Jonathan Groff on Coming Back as Kristoff

   “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” produced by Feige and Amy Pascal, recently
   surpassed “Skyfall” to become Sony Pictures’ highest worldwide box
   office grosser.

   Feige achieved his first full producer credits more than a decade ago
   on “Iron Man” and “The Incredible Hulk.” His films have a combined
   worldwide box office gross of over $26.8 billion, and he received a
   nomination for the Academy Award for best picture for producing “Black
   Panther” this year, marking the first superhero film ever to receive a
   best picture nomination.

   Feige also produced “Avengers: Endgame,” which surpassed “Avatar” this
   summer as the highest-grossing film of all time.

   In 2015, Disney, Marvel and Sony announced a deal to share the
   Spider-Man film rights, which led to Holland portraying a younger
   version of Spider-Man in  “Captain America: Civil War,” “Spider-Man:
   Homecoming,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Avengers: Endgame” and
   “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” Sony distributed the films in which
   Spider-Man was the main character while Disney handled the other
   titles.

   Sony is widely believed to be developing two more Spider-Man movies
   with Holland reprising his role as the webslinger but has not
   officially announced those titles. The news about the impasse was first
   reported by Deadline.

When Could Taylor Swift Re-Record Her Big Machine Songs? It’s Complicated

   Florida, USA - 18 Aug 2018

   Her few words echoed around the world within minutes: Asked in a
   preview of her forthcoming “CBS This Morning” interview whether she
   might re-record her master recordings from her Big Machine, which are
   now owned and controlled by her nemesis, Justin Bieber manager Scooter
   Braun, Taylor Swift said, “Oh yeah.”

   Asked whether she plans to: “Oh, absolutely.”

   No further details were provided, but the remarks open up a plethora of
   legal questions about when and how Swift could re-record her catalog,
   and thus snatch income from Big Machine by making sure that her new
   versions, and not the ones owned by her former label, are the ones
   played by fans and used in any number of commercial ventures, such as
   advertisements, TV shows, movies, games and other uses.

   [UPDATE: After this article published, Swift revealed on “Good Morning
   America” Thursday that her contract with Big Machine allows her to
   re-record songs from her first five albums beginning in November of
   next year. “My contract says starting from November 2020 I can start
   re-recording albums 1-5,” she said.”]

VMA 2019 Fashion Moments: From Taylor Swift to Lizzo to Lil Nas X

   Prince and Def Leppard are two artists who successfully went that route
   in the past when they felt they were being unfairly compensated by
   their original labels, but their contracts dated back to the 1970s.
   Record companies quickly got wise to the practice and wrote provisions
   into their standard contracts setting a time period — typically two
   years after an album’s terms expire or five years after the release of
   the recording — before those same songs, which include live versions,
   could be released.

   Without direct knowledge of Swift’s contract, unnamed sources are
   batting around both sides of the coin. On one side, the assertion that
   Swift would be unable to re-record songs from her catalog until five
   years from 2018, when her deal with Big Machine officially expired, and
   even then the process would be prohibitively complicated. For example,
   she may not have access to the album’s original artwork or even the
   names of the songs.

   On the flip side, an insider tells Variety that Swift believes she can
   re-record her classics and that a smart lawyer — Swift’s is Donald
   Passman, one of the top attorneys in the industry and the man who
   literally wrote the book on the music industry — would not allow a
   severe re-record restriction in their artist’s contract. This source
   suggests that any album more than five years old is fair game.

   Laurie Soriano, a top music industry attorney and partner in the firm
   King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano, who has no involvement in the Swift
   contract, says she doesn’t see any reason why Swift couldn’t move ahead
   with new versions of her songs and points to the practice by legacy
   artists to do the same. Once an artist’s deal with their label expires,
   that artist has “a contractural right to record for a new label and for
   [both entities] to make money off those recordings,” she tells Variety.
   “Standard language is two years after the end of the term or five years
   after the release of the recording in question.”

   However, some contracts do have what is called an original production
   or “sound alike” clause, which prohibits a newly recorded version from
   being too similar to the original — if that’s the case with her
   contract, a Swift-sung reggaeton version of “Mean” or a heavy metal
   take on “Love Story” could have moved closer to reality. But Soriano
   says it’s “an unusual provision” for a label to make seeing as interest
   in the catalogs often spurs consumption of both the original and new
   versions.

   To be sure, Swift has made her fans more than aware of her feelings
   about Braun’s acquisition of her masters, and it’s likely that a large
   percentage of them will follow her to whichever versions of her songs
   she asks them to. Then again, others may prefer the original. Any such
   confusion may ultimately have an adverse effect on perception of the
   worth of the Big Machine catalog, potentially devaluing the assets.

   On the other hand, that’s a question of the future. Right now, rights
   to master recording are seen as incredibly valuable one-of-a-kind works
   of art, not unlike that of a famous painter. If Braun were to sell
   today, at multiples of 22x to 25x, he’d be looking at a $1 billion
   valuation for a company he and backers Carlyle Group spent $300 million
   to buy.

   If Swift’s battle history is any indication, this one is far from over…

   Johnny Flynn Stardust

   Salon Pictures has unveiled a first look image of Johnny Flynn as David
   Bowie in its upcoming feature “Stardust.”

   Rising star Flynn, who recently starred in Michael Pearce’s
   BAFTA-winning debut feature “Beast” and co-starred in the ITV and
   Amazon Studio’s adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s “Vanity
   Fair,” stars as the music icon as he embarks on his first road trip to
   America in 1971 and creates his, now legendary, Ziggy Stardust persona.
   Jena Malone co-stars as Bowie’s wife Angie alongside Marc Maron as
   publicist Rob Oberman.

   The project has been described as a “origins story” and “moment in time
   film” rather than a biopic by its producers, who likened it to British
   features “Control” and “Nowhere Boy,” about Joy Division and John
   Lennon, respectively. As such it is not reliant on using Bowie’s music
   but will instead use period music songs that the musician covered, not
   his original tracks.

   The film was first announced in January and drew criticism at the time
   from Bowie’s son Duncan Jones, who said on Twitter that no music rights
   had been granted and the project did not have the family’s blessing.

   “Stardust” is directed by Gabriel Range and written by Christopher
   Bell. It is produced by Paul Van Carter and Nick Taussig for Salon. The
   film is co-financed by Christopher Figg of Piccadilly Pictures. Fabien
   Westerhoff’s Film Constellation is handling worldwide rights.

   Ryan Murphy Walk of Fame
   CREDIT: David Buchan/Variety/REX/Shutter

   At the Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, Ryan Murphy revealed that he has 10
   greenlit projects in the pipeline at Netflix, including three
   documentaries, four TV shows, and three movies.

   Murphy has previously announced five titles slated for a Netflix
   release. Three are shows, including “Ratched,” the drama series
   starring Sarah Paulson as the infamous Nurse Ratched; “The Politician,”
   a political satire featuring Ben Platt; and “Hollywood,” which focuses
   on the golden age of Tinseltown.

   He has also announced two Netflix film adaptations of Broadway
   productions. The first is “The Prom,” set for a September 2020 debut,
   and the other is “The Boys in the Band” with Jim Parsons and Zachary
   Quinto, also due out in 2020.

   Netflix said they could not provide further information about Murphy’s
   work at this time.

   The multi-hyphenate appeared on the Time 100 stage with Janet Mock, who
   writes and produces for “Pose,” the FX series Murphy co-created about
   1980s ball culture in New York City. Murphy spoke more about his record
   Netflix deal, reported to be in the $250-$300 million range. The
   five-year pact, under which Murphy will produce content exclusively for
   Netflix, began July 1, 2018, when his deal with 20th Century Fox TV
   expired.

   Murphy said signing with Netflix was both the “hardest thing I’ve ever
   done and the easiest thing I’ve ever done,” as the company gave him the
   freedom to create what he wanted and a platform to showcase new, young
   voices.

   “I was able to say what I felt my worth was, and it was met. And I was
   astonished,” Murphy said. “It was a great moment for me. I didn’t feel
   like the picked-on kid anymore.”

   When speaking on creating content in the current era, Murphy said, “If
   you’re not writing about women or gender or race, you’re not writing.”

   He added that “there aren’t any obstacles anymore” when it comes to
   progress in Hollywood and his focus is on championing more people that
   need to be heard. Although Mock said there should be diversity behind
   the camera, she noted the fact that three of the most powerful TV
   scribes are Murphy and Greg Berlanti — two gay men — and Shonda Rhimes,
   as a sign that the industry is heading in right direction.
