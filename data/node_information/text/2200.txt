   snaps-homepage

   Snaps is a portfolio theme designed to showcase portrait-oriented
   photographs, illustrations, and other works of art. The simple,
   elegant design keeps the focus on your projects, and scales to fit any
   screen size.

Getting Started

   Snaps takes advantage of the Portfolios feature on WordPress.com,
   offering unique layouts and organization for your images.

   By default, the homepage will display your latest posts in a
   traditional blog format. To get the most out of this theme, you first
   need to create some portfolio projects. Then, to display those projects
   on the homepage (as shown in the theme demo), follow these steps:
    1. Create a new page to serve as the homepage
    2. Assign the Portfolio Page Template from the Page Attributes section
    3. Publish your page
    4. Go to Customizer→ Static Front Page, and choose the new page as
       your site’s static “Front page”

   The Snaps theme will now display your Portfolio projects on the
   homepage. Please note, that the page using Portfolio Page Template
   will not support the Infinite Scroll feature.

   If you also want a blog on your site, publish a second blank page. You
   can title this page “Blog” or “News” or whatever you like. Then, go
   to Customizer→ Static Front Page, and choose this new page as
   your site’s “Posts page.”

   The title and content of the Portfolio Page Template can be hidden to
   create the same look as the theme demo. To do this, navigate to
   Customizer → Portfolio and select “Hide title and content on Portfolio
   Page Template.”

   You can also use the [portfolio] shortcode to show your projects on any
   page or post on your site.

   We’ve outlined the different sections of the Snaps homepage here:

Featured Images

   Snaps displays Featured Images in various ways, so for best results,
   set a featured image that is at least 1075 pixels wide for each of your
   posts and portfolio projects. These will display:
     * As the thumbnail image for portfolio projects; and
     * Above post titles on the blog index, archive pages, and single post
       pages.

   On the blog index and archive pages, most post formats will display the
   Featured Image at 795 pixels wide; the Image post format will display
   the Featured Image at 1075 pixels wide.

   All single posts will display the Featured Image at 1075 pixels wide.

Custom Header Image

   Snaps supports a Custom Header, shown at the top of each page of your
   site. The image will be cropped for small screens to fit the available
   space, which means not all of the header image will be visible on all
   screen sizes, so decorative background images may work best. Please
   start with an image that’s at least 1200 pixels wide by 500 pixels
   high.

   snaps-crop-header

Site Logo

   Brand Snaps further by uploading a Site Logo to display on top of the
   header. To add one, go to Customize → Site Identity, and click Add Logo
   to select an image file. The logo will display at a maximum of
   300 pixels wide and 160 pixels tall.

Menus

   Snaps has two navigation areas: the Primary Menu and the Social Links
   Menu, both of which can be edited in Customizer → Menus.

   The Primary Menu is typically used for links to pages, categories,
   posts, and external links, and can display drop-down submenus. The
   Social Links Menu links to your social media accounts, and displays an
   icon for each supported service.

   These two menus will appear below your site’s Header Image:

   The Social Menu can support the following services:
     * CodePen
     * Digg
     * Dribbble
     * Dropbox
     * Email (mailto: links)
     * Facebook
     * Flickr

     * Vimeo
     * WordPress
     * YouTube

Widgets

   Snaps has three locations for widgets in the footer. You can manage the
   widgets in Customizer → Widgets.

   If you add widgets to only one location, they will display as a single
   centered column; using two widget locations will display as two
   equal-width columns. By adding widgets to all three locations, you
   can create a footer with three equal-width columns:
