Snopes.com Participates in Facebook’s Effort to Combat Hoaxes, Fake News

Facebook announced a plan to address the circulation of false information via
social media with the help of third-party fact checkers, including
snopes.com.

   snopes
     * Published 30 November 2016

   The growing proliferation of fake news and other misinformation via
   social media over the past few years has prompted a public outcry for
   better methods of discerning and coping with the spread of falsehoods —
   an effort which has long been central to our mission as the oldest and
   most trusted fact-checking web site on the Internet.

   Since our inception in 1995, snopes.com has been dedicated to providing
   accurate, impartial analyses of rumors, hoaxes, fake news, propaganda,
   and whatever other forms false information may take.

   On 15 December 2016, Facebook announced a new initiative aimed at
   confronting the increasing volume of misinformation online by
   enhancing users’ ability to report questionable posts and providing a
   mechanism by which their accuracy can be evaluated by third-party fact
   checkers and flagged where appropriate as “disputed,” so that social
   media users can learn more and make informed choices before sharing
   them. We have agreed to participate in this experiment alongside other
   well-regarded fact checking sites.

   In doing so, the ownership and editorial staff of snopes.com wish
   to reiterate our commitment to accuracy and impartiality. Our core
   mission will not change. We expect to derive no direct financial
   benefit from this arrangement, nor will we ever relinquish our
   independence as a fact-checking organization. Our goal is to help
   empower Facebook users to better control and enhance their own online
   experience, and we believe that increasing the flow and visibility of
   accurate, vetted information is one of the best ways to do that.

   Most Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?”
   Those tips launch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of
   political, scientific, legal, historical, and visual information. We
   investigate as thoroughly and quickly as possible and relay what we
   learn. Then another question arrives, and the race starts again.

   We do this work every day at no cost to you, but it is far from free to

Snopes.com Participates in Facebook’s Effort to Combat Hoaxes, Fake News

Facebook announced a plan to address the circulation of false information via
social media with the help of third-party fact checkers, including
snopes.com.

   snopes
     * Published 30 November 2016

   The growing proliferation of fake news and other misinformation via
   social media over the past few years has prompted a public outcry for
   better methods of discerning and coping with the spread of falsehoods —
   an effort which has long been central to our mission as the oldest and
   most trusted fact-checking web site on the Internet.

   Since our inception in 1995, snopes.com has been dedicated to providing
   accurate, impartial analyses of rumors, hoaxes, fake news, propaganda,
   and whatever other forms false information may take.

   On 15 December 2016, Facebook announced a new initiative aimed at
   confronting the increasing volume of misinformation online by
   enhancing users’ ability to report questionable posts and providing a
   mechanism by which their accuracy can be evaluated by third-party fact
   checkers and flagged where appropriate as “disputed,” so that social
   media users can learn more and make informed choices before sharing
   them. We have agreed to participate in this experiment alongside other
   well-regarded fact checking sites.

   In doing so, the ownership and editorial staff of snopes.com wish
   to reiterate our commitment to accuracy and impartiality. Our core
   mission will not change. We expect to derive no direct financial
   benefit from this arrangement, nor will we ever relinquish our
   independence as a fact-checking organization. Our goal is to help
   empower Facebook users to better control and enhance their own online
   experience, and we believe that increasing the flow and visibility of
   accurate, vetted information is one of the best ways to do that.

   Most Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?”
   Those tips launch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of

   investigate as thoroughly and quickly as possible and relay what we
   learn. Then another question arrives, and the race starts again.

   We do this work every day at no cost to you, but it is far from free to
