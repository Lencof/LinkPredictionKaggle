The Boyars

   The boyars were members of the upper nobility in Russia from the 10th
   through the 17th century. Their military support of the Kievan princes
   initially earned them influence and government posts, but soon land
   ownership became the main source of their power and prestige. The
   boyars continued to advise the prince through a council, but as the
   Moscow grand princes consolidated their power, their influence was
   gradually eroded until which czar abolished the rank and title of
   boyar? More... Discuss

   Germany. Today the fair is held in the Heiligengeistfeld, or Holy Ghost
   Field, in the middle of the city. It features booths filled with toys,
   gingerbread, crafts, and other temptations for holiday shoppers. The
   Fair begins in November and doesn't close until just before Christmas,

   buy their gifts. More... Discuss
