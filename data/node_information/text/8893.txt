Rosalía Says She Feels 'Very Grateful' Representing Where She Comes From at
2019 VMAs: Watch

   Rosalía stopped to chat with Billboard’s Jordyn Rolling on the red
   carpet at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards on Monday (Aug. 26) to
   discuss her excitement over performing at the event and why it means so
   much for her to be representing where she comes from.

   The singer, who was nominated for three VMAs and took home the prize
   for best Latin music video with “Con Altura” with J Balvin and El
   Guincho, also took to the stage to perform alongside Ozuna later on in
   the evening.

   Speaking with Billboard ahead of the performance, Rosalía said, “I’m so
   excited to be here today performing because I will be performing aside
   a lot of artists that I admire a lot, so I can’t wait.”

   Asked how it feels to be at the event with other Latin artists such as
   Ozuna, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin, Rosalía notes that she feels “very
   grateful” and that coming from Barcelona, she is happy to be
   representing where she comes from.

   “We are here and it’s amazing that we can sing in Spanish in a place
   like that, it’s magic,” she adds.

   You can check out the full video interview with Rosalía above, and
   watch her VMAs performance below.
