   David Families - 04/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Big room, clean, very good twin bed, very good breakfast, very good
   location, very good price and great hospitality at the desk Only
   negative experience: China wear was not too clean (in the breakfast
   room), the water to boil eggs was too low, the paper napkins were not
   added after they were finished. (But the breakfast itself was fine!).

   Ok, nothing too great

   Alison A. Families - 02/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Took a while to check in as they couldn't find booking. Took while to
   check out as they couldn't find prepayment even though I booked on
   direct site. Not very welcoming bar area with chairs stacked on tables.
   Paid 3.5 euros for bottle of water then saw Evian for sale next morning
   at 1.50. Quite dark hotel. Good location, staff were ok, bathroom very
   basic.

   All was ok for our stay, very nice hotel, parking places outside in the
   street, very specious room and nicely decorated. Closed to the centre,
   ideal if you want to walk to restaurant, friendly staff. Lot of choices
   at breakfast. I would definitely recommend
   And I would definitely thank you for your comments ! All the staff is
   happy to reed your words... Best regards Yves Poletti

   Double charging for accommodation
   TripAdvisor rating 4.0/5

   skisell Business - 08/07/2019 TripAdvisor review

   After booking via Accorhotel web-site, I put as a security my card. The
   security deposit was charged before my arriving in one day earlier.
   When I had leaving the hotel a receptionist asked me paid for my
   staying in hotel, because from her words the hotel cannot use a
   security deposit as a payment. Therefore I was charged twice. The
   security deposit was unblocked on third day only.
   Good day When you make booking on internet, the banks made this system
   every time : block the deposit on your account, and unlocked it after
   your payment. It's not our decision it's not our functionment !... But
   finally, you pay only one time, so your title "double charge" is wrong
   and can mislead people...* Regards Yves Poletti

   Very nice.

   The staff was very polite and helpful. The room was nice and quiet and
   the break-fast was delicious. Hotel was very accessible and
   conviniently near the railway station. Restaurants and a few shops
   near.
   Good day ! Thank you for take time to post comment and thank you for
   your compliments !! When British people say that our breakfast is
   nice... I'm happy !! ;-D Have a nice day We will welcome you again with
   opleasure bests regards Yves Poletti

   Huw Couples - 08/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   All went well - the hotel was a *little* off the beaten track, but very
   competitively priced, clean and pleasant. We had a spacious room with a
   balcony, and brief but wholly positive interactions with staff. Top
   marks..!

   Surprisingly good Ibis hotel near Grand Palais
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Roland Business - 23/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   I needed to go to a conference at the Grand Palais, Lille. This hotel
   is maybe 100m away from it , so the location was really great for me.
   It's a 10min walk to the train station and city centre, so easy access
   as well. I have stayed at many Ibis hotels before. This was the nicest
   by far. The room was surprisingly big. The breakfast buffet had plenty
   to choose from (continental breakfast). There was a bar for a drink and
   the option of room service. The staff were very friendly and spoke good
   English. I certainly enjoyed my stay.

   Comfortable, quiet hotel near to Lille City Centre.
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Colin T. Families - 06/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   Hotel was just a short walk away from Lille Flanders and Lille Europe
   train stations. We had booked a triple room which had one double and
   one single bed. The room was not a very large size for being a triple
   room. The room only had one chair, strange for a triple room. We only
   had two large bath towels provided and didn't receive any hand towels
   throughout our stay although we were able to request extra bath towels
   . The room and hotel were very quiet, was not disturbed by other guests
   or traffic noise. Reception staff were friendly and helpful to sort out
   any problems. Breakfast was good with a variety of options. A good
   place to stay for a trip to Lille.

   George H. Solo - 18/04/2019 AccorHotels review

   From start to finish all staff were very friendly and helpful.
   Facilities were good and I was grateful to have a parking space on
   site- it would be ideal to be able to pre-book but I understand why
   that can’t be the case. Two minor points for development- no
   alternative language TV channels and drinks from the hotel bar rather
   expensive- nothing major particularly! Would certainly stay again.

   Terrible communication of your hotel's name
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Leon K. Business - 07/03/2019 AccorHotels review

   It is very disappointing to arrive tired from a trip and go to the
   wrong hotel simply because the name is almost the same as the other by
   the chain. I had booked at the Palais but walked to the Place Hotel.
   The difference in the name comes after the term 'ibis Lille grand
   centre&quot;. At least put the name Palais first! The staff confirmed
   that several guests have made the same mistake but no apology was given
   when it is clearly a poor communication effect by the chain. The
   receptionist at Place booked a taxi for me (paid by me) to take me to
   Place but the driver took me to a 3rd ibis in the city. She did not
   communicate the right information to the driver. Finally, I walked to
   the right hotel after 1.20 hour of being pushed around. I requested
   that the hotel (2nd ibis) would cover a taxi as this was clearly the
   first receptionist's mistake but she refused. Overall a very
   disappointing experience by a hotel chain I tend to choose when
   travelling. On another note, the stay was pleasant and the breakfast of
   very good quality

   Don’t Use room 112
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Claire H. Families - 28/01/2019 AccorHotels review

   The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable but our room had a very
   noisy vent which nobody could stop or reduce. We were not offered an
   alternative room either so we barely slept. If you get room 112, ask to
   check it before you accept it. Otherwise very convenient hotel for the
   Zenith and Casino where we were going.

   Clean comfortable room. OK...it is small but this is Ibis and not the
   Four Seasons. Staff was great. Breakfast very nice with many options
   including soft boiled eggs. Walking distance to some good restaurants.
   This my second stay here and I am sure I will stay again in the future.

   Tony S. Families - 06/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Good size family room, however does need modernizing. The flooring was
   raised in places and the bathroom is out of date. Great night sleep in
   comfortable bed. Breakfast is very nice too. Only real other complaint
   is the lack of staff on duty. Took a while to get room key even though
   checked in online. Also the restaurant was closed therefore we were
   unable to get an evening meal. Nothing else really open in the area.

   Fine, as long as you read the small print carefully.

   Anonymous Solo - 30/07/2019 AccorHotels review

   When the website advertises &quot;We have a restaurant La Compagnie
   Bistrot, as well as a bar open 24/7 and free private secure
   parking.&quot;, what it means is that you will be charged 8 euros for
   secure private parking, as stated in a different part of the website,
   which you might not have read. Very confusing, and a cost to be aware
   of. Apart from this, the experience was adequate.

   One night stop travelling through

   Perfect for my needs, 1 night stop motorcycling from Calais to Alps.
   Just over an hour from Calais after evening channel crossing. Hotel bar
   and restaurant open.

   Good value for money.

   The Ibis Lille Lomme Centre hotel is a nice and clean hotel, providing
   value for money. The staff is really polite and helpful, and the rooms
   are relatively small but clean and comfortable. Overall, the hotel is
   providing real good value for money and I would definitively recommend
   this hotel to any traveler looking for a decent hotel, with good
   restaurant, nice staff and clean rooms at a good price.

   GOOD HOTEL, GOOD SERVICE

   X6176ZDpaulh Business - 16/06/2019 TripAdvisor review

   Stayed for 2 nights on a business trip to Valenciennes which was
   totally booked out due to the ladies football world cup. Hotel was easy
   to find off the motorway and parking at the rear of the hotel made for
   an easy checkin with luggage. Check in was informal and friendly with a
   good explanation of the services and local transport links (The metro
   to central Lille is literally 1 minute outside the hotel and takes
   around 15mins to Gare de Lille Flanders). The rooms are basic and
   functional, everything is quite well thought out and does its job well.
   The sleep quality was excellent, there was no noise from outside or
   inside the hotel. An evening meal at the hotel was good value and good
   quality, the menu is a little limited and the staff seemed somewhat
   overstretched at times but overall it was a good experience. Breakfast
   was typical continental and could not be faulted, there was plenty of
   everything on offer and all the produce was fresh. I would have given
   the hotel 5 stars if the price of my stay wasnt so high but it seems I
   travelled in a week where hotels in North East France were in demand.
   Thank you for these praises. We are glad that you have had a good stay
   and will congratulate the teams. Indeed, you stayed with us during a
   week with very high demand, which is why you could not stay in
   Valenciennes. Hoping to see you again soon.

   Boom Couples - 05/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   We had booked for 2 days with breakfast, a car and a museum I had to
   ask 2 times to get the card for the museum, the coffee for the
   breakfast was really not strong even if seated an espresso. It's a pity
   that you don't ask directly if we want to be eco-friendly and get our
   room not clean during our stay. I found out that we had to say it
   ourself and on time .....

   You managed to get 38 people into the 24 rooms they requested without
   any problems Very well done . Thank you all.

   John M. Friends - 02/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   This is the second time your hotel has successfully looked after a bus
   full of English people attending a function in nearby La Chapelle.They
   were all happy with their rooms , the excellent breakfast , as well as
   an affordable price. From a personal viewpoint, I cannot thank your
   staff enough. From the very first enquiry (on both occasions) , I have
   been treated with the utmost courtesy , politeness and efficiency ( and
   in English too, thank you) by everyone I have dealt with by e-mail

   Simon M. Couples - 31/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   This was the second time that we have stayed here. It is very easy to
   find and the staff were very accommodating . The room was clean and
   comfortable although a bit small, and the single beds were very narrow.
   The beds were not very comfortable which is very unusual for Ibis.
   However, we enjoyed our stay as there is a good restaurant on the
   premises serving far better food than the usual Ibis hotel and there is
   a car park in a courtyard behind the hotel which is locked at night and
   a lift takes you directly from the car park to your floor. However, at
   8 Euros a night it is a bit expensive! Our stay was relaxed and we will
   stay there again in the future.

   EXCELLENT

   As above, however, as I mentioned to the receptionist when we checked
   out of the hotel there was a disagreeable smell in the bathroom rather
   like sewage (les eux d'egout ).
   Hello, I am sorry that your stay is badly finished. We do what is
   necessary to prevent this in the future. See you soon. Jérémy Delebarre

   Chris Families - 18/02/2019 AccorHotels review

   Excess waiting for assistance at the reception area. Poor quality
   facilities, matress toppers that slide off bed when sleeping, no kettle
   in room, hot water not working for much of one evening.
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Good check-in, car park space, clean, functional room with soft
   matress, and pleasant breakfast.
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Francis H. Friends - 19/01/2019 AccorHotels review

   The Ibis formula is good for a short stay, what I like about Ibis is
   that although the rooms are not large, they have everything required
   for your stay, and everything works. To paraphrase Le Corbusier they :
   'are a machine for staying in'. The staff were friendly and
   co-operative, and I noticed since my last stay there the restaurant/bar
   area had been refreshed. Thank you Ibis!

   excellent accueil, l'hôtesse a veillé à nous octroyer une chambre très
   calme malgré un mariage. aucune nuisance sonore intérieure ou
   extérieure. nous avons adoré la déco du 5ème étage. navette pratique
   pour l'aéroport, nous avons garé notre voiture à l'hôtel pour la durée
   de notre voyage. pack "park sleep and go"

   Hôtel très jolie et personnel agréable

   Anonyme En couple - 18/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Je dirais que l'expérience correspondait à l'essentiel, nous avons pu
   dîner et dormir mais nous n'avons pas ressenti le petit plus
   potentiellement attendu dans un hôtel Mercure.

   bel hôtel très proche aéroport, super accueil

   accueil très agréable, une chambre au calme malgré un mariage, aucune
   nuisance sonore. déco originale et très agréable, je recommande sans
   hésiter.

   Encore un petit effort pour être au top

   C. En couple - 17/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Accueil toujours parfait et sachant répondre parfaitement aux attentes
   du client En revanche même si le personnel de restauration est
   volontaire et charmant un certain désordre règne lié sans doute à leur
   nombre trop insuffisant...un certain laisser aller sur les tables du
   patio de la piscine non débarrassées vers 12h un dimanche (des morceaux
   de croissant et des tasses)...enfin un service minimum de restauration
   devrait être assuré le dimanche midi...un plus bien appréciable pour un

   Maryse En couple - 17/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Bon accueil, personnel à notre écoute, chaleureux et efficace. Chambre
   très bien insonorisée. Programme TV produits de toilette rien ne
   manquait. Pour prendre un vol à 6 h 00 ce serait bien d' avoir une
   navette à 4 h 45 vers l' aéroport

   Séjour satisfaisant globalement.

   Le lit est un peu trop mou. Il n'est pas tout à fait assez haut pour
   une personne en fauteuil roulant (+ 10 cm). Il n'est pas assez large
   pour couple (160 cm au lieu de 140 cm). La salle de bains n'est pas
   équipée d'une douche pour les personnes en fauteuil roulant (une
   baignoire, c'est en principe inutilisable).

   Genevieve M. En couple - 16/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Hôtel très proche de l’aerport,grand parking.Nous avons passé une nuit
   très calme dans une chambre très bien rénovée.Diner très agréable au
   restaurant dont la déco est sympa .Personnel accueillant et aimable.
   Petit déjeuner avec des produits variés et bons. Très bonne étape où
   nous reviendrons si nous revenons en avion à Bordeaux. 2 petites
   remarques: malgré une très belle salle de bain,le lavabo était
   bouché,ce qui aurait dû être remarqué par le service de nettoyage
   (chambre 130).Les serviettes en papier du petit déjeuner sont de
   mauvaise qualité,indignes de votre établissement.

   Tres bonne etape

   Chambre très agreable. Dîner du samedi soir lamentable avec produits
   avariés. Pas digne d’un 4 étoiles.

   Une bonne nuit comme d'habitude chez Mercure Hotels

   B. R. En couple - 09/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Un hotel très plaisant avec un lit très confortable mais
   malheureusement des Clients très bruyants qui &quot;jouaient&quot; dans
   les couloirs et faisaient claquer les portes sans arrêt alors que nous
   devions prendre un vol assez tôt. Là dessus, on se croyait au
   &quot;Formule 1&quot; de St denis... Sinon pour les reste tout était
   super (bar, restaurant, confort) et nous avons beaucoup apprécié la
   possibilité de laisser notre véhicule pour la semaine.

   Pratique pour la veille d'un voyage

   Une seule nuit avant de prendre l'avion très tôt. Le personnel à
   l'arrivée, au bar et au départ ont tous été sympathiques et souriants.
   La chambre était propre et les lieux silencieux. C'était parfait.

   Difficulté à ouvrir la porte de ma chambre (302) avec 3 clés
   défaillantes et poignées abimée. Aide nécessaire de la personne à
   l'accueil. Climatisation impossible à arrêter avec une température dans
   la chambre très froide. Encore une fois, la personne de l'accueil m'a
   aidée et a coupé la clim. Difficulté à trouver une table propre pour le
   petit déjeuner, pas de bol disponible.

   bonjour comme toujours un accueil irréprochable de l hotel des chambres
   de qualite un personnel tres accueillant et sympas mais un restaurant
   en dessous de tout impossible d etre servi d un plat en moins de 45 mn
   et je suis partis au bout de 20 mn sans avoir eu mon assiette de
   fromage qui soit dit en passant m a quand meme ete ajouter sur la note
   ( l hotel me la retire au moment de payer ) un petit dejeuner ou il a
   fallu que je dresse moi meme ma table car une seule personne ( d un
   courage et d une volonte sans faille qu il ne faut pas blâmer elle
   faisait tout son possible ) c est n importe quoi au vue de vos tarifs
   et du standing que vous pensez représenter si c etait la premier fois
   ca ne serait pas un probleme mais c est a chaque fois que je viens je
   suis toute les semaines ou presque en nuite sur merignac je ne viens
   que tres peu chez vous a cause de ca je ne viendrais plus que contrains
   et force c est dommage surtout pour moi parcequ encore une fois votre
   hotel est top

   Très accueillant,calme, agréable séjour

   Nigel W. Solo - 16/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   The room, the service and breakfast were all excellent. Online booking,
   check-in and check-out were all slick. Overall good value for money.

   comfortable airport hotel
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Agbtm Families - 11/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   good comfort in the room, nice breakfast buffet and modern spaces. but
   please ensure that the shuttle driver announces his departure in the
   hall at the hotel. I was waiting for 10 minutes for his departure and
   had told the desk officer that I was going to the airport with the
   shuttle, yet he departed very quickly without any word whatsoever.
   Twice an hour is very limited, and it should be nicer if it were on
   demand of the customer. We also had to walk to the hotel upon arrival
   shortly after midnight and again to the airport to take the rental car,
   as we did not want to wait for 25 minutes for the shuttle to go, and
   then again, a third time, when one of us departed shortly before 5.30
   am.

   Very Nice Staff, Convenient Location
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   S. Couples - 09/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   The staff was very nice both checking in and out. Both people spoke
   English which was great! We needed a taxi at 4 AM and they were happy
   to order one for us. The hotel lobby, pool, and restaurant/bar were
   clean and well appointed. The shower had mold in the grout lines, but
   every hotel I have ever stayed in while in Europe has mold...I guess
   bleach isn’t a cleaning option...but otherwise it was clean. REALLY
   need to replace the lumpy, lumpy mattress in Room 330. Also, we did not
   know if the 2 water bottles in the mini refrigerator were complimentary
   or not. One of them had been opened so we threw it out.

   Good service in a quiet building very close to the airport
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Margaret Couples - 06/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   The room was very nicely decorated on the African floor. It was very
   clean and the bathroom was up to date. We were very disappointed to
   wait 35 mins for a taxi ordered by the hotel - we suggest you use a
   different company. The free shuttle to the airport was excellent.

   Quiet rooms, helpful staff and improved furnishings.

   Very friendly reception staff, rooms ok and quiet. Convenient for
   airport as they have a shuttle or you can walk. Bar service was poor,
   very slow and several things had run out, was also expensive

   GREAT AIRPORT HOTEL
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Rebecca Couples - 01/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   WE WERE PICKED UP PROMPTLY AND WHISKED TO THE HOTEL. GREAT PLACE TO
   LIGHT FOR FLYING IN AND /OR OUT OF BORDEAUX. THE RESTAURANT WAS VERY
   GOOD AND THE ROOMS CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE. WE DID HAVE A SMALL ISSUE IN
   THE MORNING GETTING TO THE AIRPORT-JUST QUITE SLOW AND THE CLERK THAT
   WAS DRIVING WAS IN NOT HURRY TO TAKE US. WE DID GET TO THE AIRPORT IN
   TIME, BUT IF WE HAD BEEN ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A
   PROBLEM.

   Most Convenient Stay

   Anonymous Families - 08/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   I liked the room. Front desk person was very nice. But she was all
   alone so everything took a long time...to answer the phone, etc. Big
   issue was that the phone in the room did not work. I tried to call the
   front desk, for example, and it didn't work. That's not safe.

   A little haven just minutes from the airport
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Fiona Families - 06/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   I dropped off my family and the luggage at the Mercure hotel and then
   drove to the Bordeaux airport to return my rental car. Because the
   Mercure has an airport shuttle service, I was pleased to be able to
   save on day’s car rental fee. I did experience one small problem on the
   way back, however. I had inquired at the front desk before leaving as
   to how, after returning my rental car, I could catch the shuttle back
   to the hotel. I was told to go to a specific area next to the taxi
   stand and simply call the hotel and ask for the shuttle. The only
   problem for me was that I assumed that the Mercure would have a direct
   phone at the airport that I could simply pick up and connect to the
   Mercure. I have used these types of hotel phones several times before
   at other airports... Alas, there was only a sign at the Bordeaux
   airport, supplying the phone numbers of the airport hotels and I did
   not have a cellphone that worked in France. I approached a taxi driver
   and asked to be taken to the Mercure but he refused, saying that they
   were not allowed to take persons to the airport hotels...Hmmm... Now I
   was in a bit of a panic as although the hotel is not far, the walk
   there would be highly dangerous for a pedestrian. I wrote the hotel
   number down and went to the information desk inside the airport and
   explained my situation and asked if they would call the hotel for me.
   One of the two women working there (begrudgingly) made the call,
   telling me that they are not supposed to do this. (Really? I would have
   thought that was indeed part of her job, or at least that she might be
   happy to assist a visitor in need of help simply out of the kindness of
   her heart, but I digress...) The Mercure shuttle arrived within a few
   minutes and I returned to the hotel where I enjoyed a delicious late
   lunch with my family. My daughter and I then had a swim in the
   beautiful pool in the gorgeous garden behind the hotel. It felt as
   though we were in a lush oasis (complete with palm trees) miles away
   from anywhere and yet we were so close to the airport. We all enjoyed a
   good sleep on very comfortable beds before catching the hotel shuttle
   to the airport the following morning. My young daughter had slept in a
   cot that had been set up in the room so we were all well looked after
   in the room. So, other than the inability to phone the hotel from the
   airport, we experienced a super stay at the Mercure Bordeaux airport
   hotel. Perhaps in future though, the front desk staff could just check
   with foreign guests that they have the ability to use their cell phones
   in France and not assume that to be the case. We would definitely stay
   at the Mercure hotel the next time we visit the Dordogne.

   convenient

   A. Families - 05/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Arrived early to hotel (11am) due to early morning flight arrival. Was
   given my room about 11.30am. Great shuttle service, any staff I
   encountered were very helpful & polite, had dinner & breakfast very
   enjoyable,room was beautifully decorated with all the facilities I
   needed for a great stay. I do feel the trees around the pool need to be
   trimmed as 90% of the pool area is in the shade due to the trees so
   very little area to seat out in the sun & the pool is almost completely
   in the shade, the water was freezing.

   Ann F. Couples - 05/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   We had to stay one night at the airport before going on to our
   destination in Bordeaux, and chose this hotel online as it seemed to
   offer comfortable accommodation at a reasonable price. It turned out to
   be a lovely start to our holiday as we were able to enjoy the pool and
   have a delicious dinner before joining out friends. The room was very
   good and the staff were efficient and friendly.

   What a gem for an airport hotel!

   Peter L. Families - 30/07/2019 AccorHotels review

   Was okay, but toilet flush was faulty and wasn't properly fixed even
   after the maintenance man came to fix it. Breakfast was okay, liked the
   fresh orange juice and the coffee, but the welcome we got was from a
   tired and unenthusiastic waitress. Room itself was fine - clean, good
   bedding. Also nobody answered when we called from the airport to check
   if the shuttle bus was coming.

   Let down by poor restaurant service
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Nice H. B. E. E. Business - 26/07/2019 AccorHotels review

   Nice hotel but experience spoilt by poor service in restaurant- now I
   can understand why my colleagues normally eat e. when staying there.

   The hotel was conveniently situated by the airport but the service was
   minimal due to it being a weekend. (No restaurant). Also we didn't get
   our wake-up call as requested. Luckily we had an alarm clock.

   TripAdvisor rating 3.5/5

   Stonks Solo travel - 05/06/2019 TripAdvisor review

   Needs a good make-over, and better housekeeping to be worthy of the
   Ibis brand. I booked this hotel by mistake, as I have often stayed at
   the Ibis Budget, which is better in all respects, and closer to the
   airport.
   Thank you for taking time to give us a feedback regarding your stay in
   our hotel. We are sorry to read that you did not have a good time with
   us and we would like to apologize. Our hotel has had a recent
   refurbishment, sadly you did not enjoy it. However, we are looking
   forward to welcoming you again soon. Kind regards, Mickael

   David B. Solo - 03/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   Very convenient for the airport, although not walking distance unlike
   Ibis Styles. Good restaurant opposite with huge buffet of Asian food
   for Euros 20, but apart from location, this property needs a good
   upgrade to avoid damaging Ibis brand. Housekeeping not up to scratch in
   the bathrooms and bedroom carpets. Either that or sell the property -
   you have plenty of other good hotels at the airport, and I booked this
   one by mistake - won't make that mistake again!

   Excellent place for a good rest after a long travel. Comfortable and

   and delicious local products. So close to the Merignac airport and easy
   access to the toll roads around Bordeaux.

   Room too warm, room too small but staff were excellent!
   Customer review rating 4.0/5

   Anonymous Couples - 16/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   Stayed for one night as very early flight to catch the next day. Room
   was compact & not much space for cases etc. Room was also very warm,
   unable to open the window as a raging storm blowing throughout the
   night. Overall, it was ok! Apart from the wife's snoring. But the staff
   were very friendly & helpful. The man at reception even phoned the
   local bar to check they were open (as we stayed on a Bank Holiday).
   Dear Guest, Thank you for the great review of our hotel! We are glad
   that you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again very soon.

   Everything fine. Except that when I paid with my credit card I was
   given the credit card slip but no invoice. Yesterday morning. In the
   afternoon I called and was told invoice will be sent by email. Tonight
   26 hours after this call, still no email with invoice. This is spoiling
   what had been a good experience.

   Good experience, compact room, with modern bathroom. Best for an
   overnight stay. Reception experience good. Breakfast good. Navette to
   airport worked well although it does not start from hotel but from
   Novotel which could be awkward if raining heavily. Downside - no onsite
   restaurant for evening meal and Novotel restaurant menu not inspiring,
   but two other local restaurants available within easy walking distance

   David Families - 04/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Big room, clean, very good twin bed, very good breakfast, very good
   location, very good price and great hospitality at the desk Only
   negative experience: China wear was not too clean (in the breakfast
   room), the water to boil eggs was too low, the paper napkins were not
   added after they were finished. (But the breakfast itself was fine!).

   Ok, nothing too great

   Alison A. Families - 02/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Took a while to check in as they couldn't find booking. Took while to
   check out as they couldn't find prepayment even though I booked on
   direct site. Not very welcoming bar area with chairs stacked on tables.
   Paid 3.5 euros for bottle of water then saw Evian for sale next morning
   at 1.50. Quite dark hotel. Good location, staff were ok, bathroom very
   basic.

   severinel9 Business - 29/07/2019 TripAdvisor review

   All was ok for our stay, very nice hotel, parking places outside in the
   street, very specious room and nicely decorated. Closed to the centre,
   ideal if you want to walk to restaurant, friendly staff. Lot of choices
   at breakfast. I would definitely recommend
   And I would definitely thank you for your comments ! All the staff is
   happy to reed your words... Best regards Yves Poletti

   Double charging for accommodation
   TripAdvisor rating 4.0/5

   skisell Business - 08/07/2019 TripAdvisor review

   After booking via Accorhotel web-site, I put as a security my card. The
   security deposit was charged before my arriving in one day earlier.
   When I had leaving the hotel a receptionist asked me paid for my
   staying in hotel, because from her words the hotel cannot use a
   security deposit as a payment. Therefore I was charged twice. The
   security deposit was unblocked on third day only.
   Good day When you make booking on internet, the banks made this system
   every time : block the deposit on your account, and unlocked it after
   your payment. It's not our decision it's not our functionment !... But
   finally, you pay only one time, so your title "double charge" is wrong
   and can mislead people...* Regards Yves Poletti

   Very nice.

   The staff was very polite and helpful. The room was nice and quiet and
   the break-fast was delicious. Hotel was very accessible and
   conviniently near the railway station. Restaurants and a few shops
   near.
   Good day ! Thank you for take time to post comment and thank you for
   your compliments !! When British people say that our breakfast is
   nice... I'm happy !! ;-D Have a nice day We will welcome you again with
   opleasure bests regards Yves Poletti

   Huw Couples - 08/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   All went well - the hotel was a *little* off the beaten track, but very
   competitively priced, clean and pleasant. We had a spacious room with a
   balcony, and brief but wholly positive interactions with staff. Top
   marks..!

   Surprisingly good Ibis hotel near Grand Palais
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Roland Business - 23/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   I needed to go to a conference at the Grand Palais, Lille. This hotel
   is maybe 100m away from it , so the location was really great for me.
   It's a 10min walk to the train station and city centre, so easy access
   as well. I have stayed at many Ibis hotels before. This was the nicest
   by far. The room was surprisingly big. The breakfast buffet had plenty
   to choose from (continental breakfast). There was a bar for a drink and
   the option of room service. The staff were very friendly and spoke good
   English. I certainly enjoyed my stay.

   Comfortable, quiet hotel near to Lille City Centre.
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Colin T. Families - 06/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   Hotel was just a short walk away from Lille Flanders and Lille Europe
   train stations. We had booked a triple room which had one double and
   one single bed. The room was not a very large size for being a triple
   room. The room only had one chair, strange for a triple room. We only
   had two large bath towels provided and didn't receive any hand towels
   throughout our stay although we were able to request extra bath towels
   . The room and hotel were very quiet, was not disturbed by other guests
   or traffic noise. Reception staff were friendly and helpful to sort out
   any problems. Breakfast was good with a variety of options. A good
   place to stay for a trip to Lille.

   George H. Solo - 18/04/2019 AccorHotels review

   From start to finish all staff were very friendly and helpful.
   Facilities were good and I was grateful to have a parking space on
   site- it would be ideal to be able to pre-book but I understand why
   that can’t be the case. Two minor points for development- no
   alternative language TV channels and drinks from the hotel bar rather
   expensive- nothing major particularly! Would certainly stay again.

   Terrible communication of your hotel's name
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Leon K. Business - 07/03/2019 AccorHotels review

   It is very disappointing to arrive tired from a trip and go to the
   wrong hotel simply because the name is almost the same as the other by
   the chain. I had booked at the Palais but walked to the Place Hotel.
   The difference in the name comes after the term 'ibis Lille grand
   centre&quot;. At least put the name Palais first! The staff confirmed
   that several guests have made the same mistake but no apology was given
   when it is clearly a poor communication effect by the chain. The
   receptionist at Place booked a taxi for me (paid by me) to take me to
   Place but the driver took me to a 3rd ibis in the city. She did not
   communicate the right information to the driver. Finally, I walked to
   the right hotel after 1.20 hour of being pushed around. I requested
   that the hotel (2nd ibis) would cover a taxi as this was clearly the
   first receptionist's mistake but she refused. Overall a very
   disappointing experience by a hotel chain I tend to choose when
   travelling. On another note, the stay was pleasant and the breakfast of
   very good quality

   with simple and efficient temperature regulation.

   Don’t Use room 112
   Customer review rating 4.4/5

   Claire H. Families - 28/01/2019 AccorHotels review

   The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable but our room had a very
   noisy vent which nobody could stop or reduce. We were not offered an
   alternative room either so we barely slept. If you get room 112, ask to
   check it before you accept it. Otherwise very convenient hotel for the
   Zenith and Casino where we were going.

   Clean comfortable room. OK...it is small but this is Ibis and not the
   Four Seasons. Staff was great. Breakfast very nice with many options
   including soft boiled eggs. Walking distance to some good restaurants.
   This my second stay here and I am sure I will stay again in the future.

   Tony S. Families - 06/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Good size family room, however does need modernizing. The flooring was
   raised in places and the bathroom is out of date. Great night sleep in
   comfortable bed. Breakfast is very nice too. Only real other complaint
   is the lack of staff on duty. Took a while to get room key even though
   checked in online. Also the restaurant was closed therefore we were
   unable to get an evening meal. Nothing else really open in the area.

   Fine, as long as you read the small print carefully.

   When the website advertises &quot;We have a restaurant La Compagnie
   Bistrot, as well as a bar open 24/7 and free private secure
   parking.&quot;, what it means is that you will be charged 8 euros for
   secure private parking, as stated in a different part of the website,
   which you might not have read. Very confusing, and a cost to be aware
   of. Apart from this, the experience was adequate.

   The Ibis Lille Lomme Centre hotel is a nice and clean hotel, providing
   value for money. The staff is really polite and helpful, and the rooms
   are relatively small but clean and comfortable. Overall, the hotel is
   providing real good value for money and I would definitively recommend
   this hotel to any traveler looking for a decent hotel, with good
   restaurant, nice staff and clean rooms at a good price.

   X6176ZDpaulh Business - 16/06/2019 TripAdvisor review

   Stayed for 2 nights on a business trip to Valenciennes which was
   totally booked out due to the ladies football world cup. Hotel was easy
   to find off the motorway and parking at the rear of the hotel made for
   an easy checkin with luggage. Check in was informal and friendly with a
   good explanation of the services and local transport links (The metro
   to central Lille is literally 1 minute outside the hotel and takes
   around 15mins to Gare de Lille Flanders). The rooms are basic and
   functional, everything is quite well thought out and does its job well.
   The sleep quality was excellent, there was no noise from outside or
   inside the hotel. An evening meal at the hotel was good value and good
   quality, the menu is a little limited and the staff seemed somewhat
   overstretched at times but overall it was a good experience. Breakfast
   was typical continental and could not be faulted, there was plenty of
   everything on offer and all the produce was fresh. I would have given
   the hotel 5 stars if the price of my stay wasnt so high but it seems I
   travelled in a week where hotels in North East France were in demand.
   Thank you for these praises. We are glad that you have had a good stay
   and will congratulate the teams. Indeed, you stayed with us during a
   week with very high demand, which is why you could not stay in
   Valenciennes. Hoping to see you again soon.

   Boom Couples - 05/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   We had booked for 2 days with breakfast, a car and a museum I had to
   ask 2 times to get the card for the museum, the coffee for the
   breakfast was really not strong even if seated an espresso. It's a pity
   that you don't ask directly if we want to be eco-friendly and get our
   room not clean during our stay. I found out that we had to say it
   ourself and on time .....

   You managed to get 38 people into the 24 rooms they requested without
   any problems Very well done . Thank you all.
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   John M. Friends - 02/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   This is the second time your hotel has successfully looked after a bus
   full of English people attending a function in nearby La Chapelle.They
   were all happy with their rooms , the excellent breakfast , as well as
   an affordable price. From a personal viewpoint, I cannot thank your
   staff enough. From the very first enquiry (on both occasions) , I have
   been treated with the utmost courtesy , politeness and efficiency ( and
   in English too, thank you) by everyone I have dealt with by e-mail
   Special thanks to Dimitri who did the allocation of rooms and keys in
   advance ,as I had requested, of our arrival on the Saturday.Saved us
   all a lot of time. A very good stay . Thank you all again. John M.

   nice easy to reach hotel for your journey
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Simon M. Couples - 31/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   This was the second time that we have stayed here. It is very easy to
   find and the staff were very accommodating . The room was clean and
   comfortable although a bit small, and the single beds were very narrow.
   The beds were not very comfortable which is very unusual for Ibis.
   However, we enjoyed our stay as there is a good restaurant on the
   premises serving far better food than the usual Ibis hotel and there is
   a car park in a courtyard behind the hotel which is locked at night and
   a lift takes you directly from the car park to your floor. However, at
   8 Euros a night it is a bit expensive! Our stay was relaxed and we will
   stay there again in the future.

   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Francis H. Friends - 19/01/2019 AccorHotels review

   The Ibis formula is good for a short stay, what I like about Ibis is
   that although the rooms are not large, they have everything required
   for your stay, and everything works. To paraphrase Le Corbusier they :
   'are a machine for staying in'. The staff were friendly and
   co-operative, and I noticed since my last stay there the restaurant/bar
   area had been refreshed. Thank you Ibis!

   excellent accueil, l'hôtesse a veillé à nous octroyer une chambre très
   calme malgré un mariage. aucune nuisance sonore intérieure ou
   extérieure. nous avons adoré la déco du 5ème étage. navette pratique
   pour l'aéroport, nous avons garé notre voiture à l'hôtel pour la durée
   de notre voyage. pack "park sleep and go"

   Anonyme En couple - 18/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Je dirais que l'expérience correspondait à l'essentiel, nous avons pu
   dîner et dormir mais nous n'avons pas ressenti le petit plus
   potentiellement attendu dans un hôtel Mercure.

   bel hôtel très proche aéroport, super accueil

   accueil très agréable, une chambre au calme malgré un mariage, aucune
   nuisance sonore. déco originale et très agréable, je recommande sans
   hésiter.

   C. En couple - 17/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Accueil toujours parfait et sachant répondre parfaitement aux attentes
   du client En revanche même si le personnel de restauration est
   volontaire et charmant un certain désordre règne lié sans doute à leur
   nombre trop insuffisant...un certain laisser aller sur les tables du
   patio de la piscine non débarrassées vers 12h un dimanche (des morceaux
   de croissant et des tasses)...enfin un service minimum de restauration
   devrait être assuré le dimanche midi...un plus bien appréciable pour un
   4*

   Bon accueil, personnel à notre écoute, chaleureux et efficace. Chambre
   très bien insonorisée. Programme TV produits de toilette rien ne
   manquait. Pour prendre un vol à 6 h 00 ce serait bien d' avoir une
   navette à 4 h 45 vers l' aéroport

   Séjour satisfaisant globalement.

   Anonyme En couple - 17/09/2019 Avis AccorHotels

   Le lit est un peu trop mou. Il n'est pas tout à fait assez haut pour
   une personne en fauteuil roulant (+ 10 cm). Il n'est pas assez large
   pour couple (160 cm au lieu de 140 cm). La salle de bains n'est pas
   équipée d'une douche pour les personnes en fauteuil roulant (une
   baignoire, c'est en principe inutilisable).

   Hôtel très proche de l’aerport,grand parking.Nous avons passé une nuit
   très calme dans une chambre très bien rénovée.Diner très agréable au
   restaurant dont la déco est sympa .Personnel accueillant et aimable.
   Petit déjeuner avec des produits variés et bons. Très bonne étape où
   nous reviendrons si nous revenons en avion à Bordeaux. 2 petites
   remarques: malgré une très belle salle de bain,le lavabo était
   bouché,ce qui aurait dû être remarqué par le service de nettoyage
   (chambre 130).Les serviettes en papier du petit déjeuner sont de
   mauvaise qualité,indignes de votre établissement.

   Tres bonne etape

   Chambre très agreable. Dîner du samedi soir lamentable avec produits
   avariés. Pas digne d’un 4 étoiles.

   Un hotel très plaisant avec un lit très confortable mais
   malheureusement des Clients très bruyants qui &quot;jouaient&quot; dans
   les couloirs et faisaient claquer les portes sans arrêt alors que nous
   devions prendre un vol assez tôt. Là dessus, on se croyait au
   &quot;Formule 1&quot; de St denis... Sinon pour les reste tout était
   super (bar, restaurant, confort) et nous avons beaucoup apprécié la
   possibilité de laisser notre véhicule pour la semaine.

   Pratique pour la veille d'un voyage

   Une seule nuit avant de prendre l'avion très tôt. Le personnel à
   l'arrivée, au bar et au départ ont tous été sympathiques et souriants.
   La chambre était propre et les lieux silencieux. C'était parfait.

   Difficulté à ouvrir la porte de ma chambre (302) avec 3 clés
   défaillantes et poignées abimée. Aide nécessaire de la personne à
   l'accueil. Climatisation impossible à arrêter avec une température dans
   la chambre très froide. Encore une fois, la personne de l'accueil m'a
   aidée et a coupé la clim. Difficulté à trouver une table propre pour le
   petit déjeuner, pas de bol disponible.

   bonjour comme toujours un accueil irréprochable de l hotel des chambres
   de qualite un personnel tres accueillant et sympas mais un restaurant
   en dessous de tout impossible d etre servi d un plat en moins de 45 mn
   et je suis partis au bout de 20 mn sans avoir eu mon assiette de
   fromage qui soit dit en passant m a quand meme ete ajouter sur la note
   ( l hotel me la retire au moment de payer ) un petit dejeuner ou il a
   fallu que je dresse moi meme ma table car une seule personne ( d un
   courage et d une volonte sans faille qu il ne faut pas blâmer elle
   faisait tout son possible ) c est n importe quoi au vue de vos tarifs
   et du standing que vous pensez représenter si c etait la premier fois
   ca ne serait pas un probleme mais c est a chaque fois que je viens je
   suis toute les semaines ou presque en nuite sur merignac je ne viens
   que tres peu chez vous a cause de ca je ne viendrais plus que contrains
   et force c est dommage surtout pour moi parcequ encore une fois votre
   hotel est top

   Très accueillant,calme, agréable séjour

   The room, the service and breakfast were all excellent. Online booking,
   check-in and check-out were all slick. Overall good value for money.

   comfortable airport hotel
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Agbtm Families - 11/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   good comfort in the room, nice breakfast buffet and modern spaces. but
   please ensure that the shuttle driver announces his departure in the
   hall at the hotel. I was waiting for 10 minutes for his departure and
   had told the desk officer that I was going to the airport with the
   shuttle, yet he departed very quickly without any word whatsoever.
   Twice an hour is very limited, and it should be nicer if it were on
   demand of the customer. We also had to walk to the hotel upon arrival
   shortly after midnight and again to the airport to take the rental car,
   as we did not want to wait for 25 minutes for the shuttle to go, and
   then again, a third time, when one of us departed shortly before 5.30
   am.

   Very Nice Staff, Convenient Location

   S. Couples - 09/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   The staff was very nice both checking in and out. Both people spoke
   English which was great! We needed a taxi at 4 AM and they were happy
   to order one for us. The hotel lobby, pool, and restaurant/bar were
   clean and well appointed. The shower had mold in the grout lines, but
   every hotel I have ever stayed in while in Europe has mold...I guess
   bleach isn’t a cleaning option...but otherwise it was clean. REALLY
   need to replace the lumpy, lumpy mattress in Room 330. Also, we did not
   know if the 2 water bottles in the mini refrigerator were complimentary
   or not. One of them had been opened so we threw it out.

   Good service in a quiet building very close to the airport
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Margaret Couples - 06/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   The room was very nicely decorated on the African floor. It was very
   clean and the bathroom was up to date. We were very disappointed to
   wait 35 mins for a taxi ordered by the hotel - we suggest you use a
   different company. The free shuttle to the airport was excellent.

   Quiet rooms, helpful staff and improved furnishings.

   Anonymous Families - 02/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   Very friendly reception staff, rooms ok and quiet. Convenient for
   airport as they have a shuttle or you can walk. Bar service was poor,
   very slow and several things had run out, was also expensive

   GREAT AIRPORT HOTEL
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Rebecca Couples - 01/09/2019 AccorHotels review

   WE WERE PICKED UP PROMPTLY AND WHISKED TO THE HOTEL. GREAT PLACE TO
   LIGHT FOR FLYING IN AND /OR OUT OF BORDEAUX. THE RESTAURANT WAS VERY
   GOOD AND THE ROOMS CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE. WE DID HAVE A SMALL ISSUE IN
   THE MORNING GETTING TO THE AIRPORT-JUST QUITE SLOW AND THE CLERK THAT
   WAS DRIVING WAS IN NOT HURRY TO TAKE US. WE DID GET TO THE AIRPORT IN
   TIME, BUT IF WE HAD BEEN ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A
   PROBLEM.

   Most Convenient Stay

   Anonymous Families - 08/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   I liked the room. Front desk person was very nice. But she was all
   alone so everything took a long time...to answer the phone, etc. Big
   issue was that the phone in the room did not work. I tried to call the
   front desk, for example, and it didn't work. That's not safe.

   A little haven just minutes from the airport
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Fiona Families - 06/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   I dropped off my family and the luggage at the Mercure hotel and then
   drove to the Bordeaux airport to return my rental car. Because the
   Mercure has an airport shuttle service, I was pleased to be able to
   save on day’s car rental fee. I did experience one small problem on the
   way back, however. I had inquired at the front desk before leaving as
   to how, after returning my rental car, I could catch the shuttle back
   to the hotel. I was told to go to a specific area next to the taxi
   stand and simply call the hotel and ask for the shuttle. The only
   problem for me was that I assumed that the Mercure would have a direct
   phone at the airport that I could simply pick up and connect to the
   Mercure. I have used these types of hotel phones several times before
   at other airports... Alas, there was only a sign at the Bordeaux
   airport, supplying the phone numbers of the airport hotels and I did
   not have a cellphone that worked in France. I approached a taxi driver
   and asked to be taken to the Mercure but he refused, saying that they
   were not allowed to take persons to the airport hotels...Hmmm... Now I
   was in a bit of a panic as although the hotel is not far, the walk
   there would be highly dangerous for a pedestrian. I wrote the hotel
   number down and went to the information desk inside the airport and
   explained my situation and asked if they would call the hotel for me.
   One of the two women working there (begrudgingly) made the call,
   telling me that they are not supposed to do this. (Really? I would have
   thought that was indeed part of her job, or at least that she might be
   happy to assist a visitor in need of help simply out of the kindness of
   her heart, but I digress...) The Mercure shuttle arrived within a few
   minutes and I returned to the hotel where I enjoyed a delicious late
   lunch with my family. My daughter and I then had a swim in the
   beautiful pool in the gorgeous garden behind the hotel. It felt as
   though we were in a lush oasis (complete with palm trees) miles away
   from anywhere and yet we were so close to the airport. We all enjoyed a
   good sleep on very comfortable beds before catching the hotel shuttle
   to the airport the following morning. My young daughter had slept in a
   cot that had been set up in the room so we were all well looked after
   in the room. So, other than the inability to phone the hotel from the
   airport, we experienced a super stay at the Mercure Bordeaux airport
   hotel. Perhaps in future though, the front desk staff could just check
   with foreign guests that they have the ability to use their cell phones
   in France and not assume that to be the case. We would definitely stay
   at the Mercure hotel the next time we visit the Dordogne.

   convenient

   A. Families - 05/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   Arrived early to hotel (11am) due to early morning flight arrival. Was
   given my room about 11.30am. Great shuttle service, any staff I
   encountered were very helpful & polite, had dinner & breakfast very
   enjoyable,room was beautifully decorated with all the facilities I
   needed for a great stay. I do feel the trees around the pool need to be
   trimmed as 90% of the pool area is in the shade due to the trees so
   very little area to seat out in the sun & the pool is almost completely
   in the shade, the water was freezing.

   Ann F. Couples - 05/08/2019 AccorHotels review

   We had to stay one night at the airport before going on to our
   destination in Bordeaux, and chose this hotel online as it seemed to
   offer comfortable accommodation at a reasonable price. It turned out to
   be a lovely start to our holiday as we were able to enjoy the pool and
   have a delicious dinner before joining out friends. The room was very
   good and the staff were efficient and friendly.

   What a gem for an airport hotel!

   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Peter L. Families - 30/07/2019 AccorHotels review

   Was okay, but toilet flush was faulty and wasn't properly fixed even
   after the maintenance man came to fix it. Breakfast was okay, liked the
   fresh orange juice and the coffee, but the welcome we got was from a
   tired and unenthusiastic waitress. Room itself was fine - clean, good
   bedding. Also nobody answered when we called from the airport to check
   if the shuttle bus was coming.

   Let down by poor restaurant service
   Customer review rating 4.2/5

   Nice H. B. E. E. Business - 26/07/2019 AccorHotels review

   Nice hotel but experience spoilt by poor service in restaurant- now I
   can understand why my colleagues normally eat e. when staying there.

   The hotel was conveniently situated by the airport but the service was
   minimal due to it being a weekend. (No restaurant). Also we didn't get
   our wake-up call as requested. Luckily we had an alarm clock.

   TripAdvisor rating 3.5/5

   Stonks Solo travel - 05/06/2019 TripAdvisor review

   Needs a good make-over, and better housekeeping to be worthy of the
   Ibis brand. I booked this hotel by mistake, as I have often stayed at
   the Ibis Budget, which is better in all respects, and closer to the
   airport.
   Thank you for taking time to give us a feedback regarding your stay in
   our hotel. We are sorry to read that you did not have a good time with
   us and we would like to apologize. Our hotel has had a recent
   refurbishment, sadly you did not enjoy it. However, we are looking
   forward to welcoming you again soon. Kind regards, Mickael

   David B. Solo - 03/06/2019 AccorHotels review

   Very convenient for the airport, although not walking distance unlike
   Ibis Styles. Good restaurant opposite with huge buffet of Asian food
   for Euros 20, but apart from location, this property needs a good
   upgrade to avoid damaging Ibis brand. Housekeeping not up to scratch in
   the bathrooms and bedroom carpets. Either that or sell the property -
   you have plenty of other good hotels at the airport, and I booked this
   one by mistake - won't make that mistake again!

   Excellent place for a good rest after a long travel. Comfortable and
   clean room. Excellent breakfast and dinner at the restaurant with fresh
   and delicious local products. So close to the Merignac airport and easy
   access to the toll roads around Bordeaux.
   Thank you very much for your great review regarding your stay in our
   hotel. We are very pleased to read that you had a great time with us.
   We are looking forward to welcoming you again soon. Kind regards,

   Room too warm, room too small but staff were excellent!
   Customer review rating 4.0/5

   Anonymous Couples - 16/05/2019 AccorHotels review

   Stayed for one night as very early flight to catch the next day. Room
   was compact & not much space for cases etc. Room was also very warm,
   unable to open the window as a raging storm blowing throughout the
   night. Overall, it was ok! Apart from the wife's snoring. But the staff
   were very friendly & helpful. The man at reception even phoned the
   local bar to check they were open (as we stayed on a Bank Holiday).
   Dear Guest, Thank you for the great review of our hotel! We are glad
   that you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again very soon.

   Everything fine. Except that when I paid with my credit card I was
   given the credit card slip but no invoice. Yesterday morning. In the
   afternoon I called and was told invoice will be sent by email. Tonight
   26 hours after this call, still no email with invoice. This is spoiling
   what had been a good experience.

   Good experience, compact room, with modern bathroom. Best for an
   overnight stay. Reception experience good. Breakfast good. Navette to
   airport worked well although it does not start from hotel but from
   Novotel which could be awkward if raining heavily. Downside - no onsite
   restaurant for evening meal and Novotel restaurant menu not inspiring,
   but two other local restaurants available within easy walking distance
