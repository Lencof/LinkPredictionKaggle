       Ayn,
       I am a big fan of your blog and I have started a new project called
       Aristoddlers. The goal of the project is to help kids learn some
       Ancient Greek and Roman lessons through entertaining stories. I
       have written my first book Aristoddlers and The Greedy King. If you
       or any of your followers would like me to send you a proof of the
       book I would be happy to and here is the link on Kickstarter:
       http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1490457402/aristoddlers-and-the
       -greedy-king
       Thanks so much!
