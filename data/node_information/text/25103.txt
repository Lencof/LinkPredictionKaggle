How to Start a Blog From Scratch – A Comprehensive Guide

   Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past decade or so,
   you’ve probably noticed the sudden increase in blogging websites.

   Regardless of the nature of your business, setting up a web presence is
   more important than ever before. And once you’ve got your website in
   place, you’ll need a blog to go with it – after all, blogging is
   perhaps one of the most powerful tools you can leverage to boost sales,
   attract new customers and build brand credibility with existing
   clients.

   With all of this in mind, we’ve decided to put together a comprehensive
   yet simple-to-follow step by step guide to help you create your very
   own blog from scratch. In this article, you’ll find everything you need
   from purchasing a domain name to selecting a hosting provider and
   installing software to publishing your first blog post.

   Let’s get started building your first blog!

5 Steps to Start a Blog

   Let me start off by saying that you don’t need to be programming
   literate to follow this practical guide – in fact, you won’t have to
   write a single line of code. To those of you who shy away from the mere
   thought of coding (don’t worry; I’m no stranger in that community!) I
   say “Fear not, for this guide is with you.”

   I’ll walk you through five simple steps to help you launch your blog:
    1. Choose a Blogging Platform
    2. Choose Suitable Hosting
    3. Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting
    4. Customize Your Blog
    5. Add Useful Plugins

   Now that we’ve gotten all of the preliminary details out of the ways,
   let’s jump right into the tutorial. You’ll have it up and running in
   the next 15 minutes – I kid you not!
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 1

Choose a Blogging Platform

   The first thing you’ll have to do is select a content management system
   (CMS) that will serve as the underlying platform for your blog. Now
   you’ve probably heard of a few of the major blogging platforms out
   there – WordPress, Blogger, Joomla, Drupal, etc.

WordPress All The Way

   I’m a huge advocate of WordPress and I wholeheartedly recommend it to
   anyone who wants to start their own blog. Here are a few simple reasons
   why:
     * It’s massive. As of the writing of this article, WordPress powers
       nearly 74.6 million websites.
     * It’s absolutely free. WordPress was essentially designed to be an
       open source project.

     * It’s secure and reliable. The dedicated team of developers behind
       WordPress, Automattic, is always updating the CMS to ensure maximum
       safety. If it’s safe enough for NASA, chances are it’s safe enough
       for you.
     * It’s scalable. Whether you want to launch a personal blog or are in
       hopes of a much bigger, CNN-sized site (yes, CNN runs on WordPress,
       too!), you can rest assured that it’ll operate without any
       glitches.

   Those of you who are launching their first blog and probably don’t have
   a ton of potential traffic lined up are far better off opting for
   WordPress. Aside from the platform-specific benefits the CMS offers,
   it’ll save you a ton of time, effort, and money.

   Hosting with WordPress is low-cost and installation takes 5 minutes.
   The best part, however, is and will always be that you don’t need to be
   exceptionally skilled in a web programming language (or even know the
   ABC’s of it) to launch and operate a successful WordPress-based blog.

   If you’re convinced that WordPress really is the best CMS out there,
   let’s move on to the next section.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 2

Choose Suitable Hosting

   Now that you’ve made the right decision in choosing WordPress as your
   CMS, there’s just one more choice to make – choosing a type of hosting
   provider.

   The decision you make at this stage will have a colossal effect on the
   outcome of your blog. You can choose to fork out a couple of dollars
   every month for self-hosting or go for a free alternative instead. And
   although the latter sounds absolutely incredible, that’s not the
   direction you’ll want to head in.

Why You Should Avoid Free Blog Sites

   With free blogging platforms (non-hosted platforms) the disadvantages
   always outnumber the advantages. Always. For starters, you get a
   terrible domain name – something like
   ‘myblog.freebloggingplatform.com’. Your blog’s domain name has a
   significant impact on SEO and social media marketing so if you want
   your blog to really take off and be discoverable then you’ll want to go
   with a self-hosting.

   A .com extension is the standard norm and nearly 75% of all websites
   have it. I’m not saying it’s impossible to attract millions of unique
   monthly page views with a .freebloggingplatform.com extension but how
   many successful bloggers (or any successful site for that matter) do
   you know by that domain name extension?

     “Brand is the sum total of how someone perceives a particular
     organization.”

   You want a web address that rolls off the tongue easily. One that
   people will remember. One that tactfully illustrates your brand and
   communicates what your blog is all about in a concise yet relevant set
   of characters.

Disadvantages of Non-Hosted Blogging Platforms

     * URL Problem. Your blog’s URL will be long, unappealing, and
       unprofessional.
     * No Real Ownership. Since you’re not paying for hosting, your blog
       won’t actually be your blog – it’s hosted on someone else’s web
       property. This means that they can delete it whenever they want.
     * Other Restrictions. Free blogging platforms don’t let you do all
       the cool stuff like monetize your blog, use themes, or install
       plugins. Worst of all, your site’s space on the server is limited
       which means you can’t even upload all of the images and videos you
       were hoping would attract traffic.

   These are factors that most of us simply can’t afford to compromise on.
   They are essential to the timely success of our blog and we’re willing
   to spend a few bucks for it.

   Luckily enough for you, I’ve worked out the most optimal and
   cost-efficient solution after carefully analyzing the hosting industry.
   (It’s a difficult and confusing world to navigate through.) Long story
   short: Bluehost is the winner.

Why Bluehost Is Best

   Bluehost offers everything from shared hosting to optimized hosting for
   WordPress at a reasonable price. Being a first-time webmaster, it’s
   best to go for shared hosting. The rest of them are advanced hosting
   services and more suitable for bigger blogs. You won’t need the kind of
   functionality they offer right away and when you feel like you do, you
   can always upgrade to another hosting plan.

   Bluehost’s Shared Hosting plan is an ideal candidate for several
   reasons:
    1. WordPress users get a special discount price at $3.49/month.
    2. You’ll get a free domain name.
    3. 1-click WordPress install.
    4. 24/7 support.
    5. 30-day money back guarantee.

   It stands to reason that WordPress and Bluehost go hand in hand — the
   best CMS paired with an affordable and reliable hosting provider. In
   the next section, we’ll walk you through a simple procedure to set up
   your domain name and hosting service with Bluehost.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 3

Set Up Your Domain Name and Hosting

   Click here to visit the Bluehost homepage to begin setting up your
   first blog. We'll receive a commission if you decided to purchase
   through these links.

   1. On the Bluehost homepage, you’ll find products in the menu bar.
   Hover over it and click on shared hosting.
   Bluehost's products menu.

   Select shared hosting from the products menu.

   2. You will be redirected to a page that gives you a brief overview of
   Bluehost’s shared hosting plan. Click on the green get started now
   button to proceed with the setup.
   Get started now button.

   Get started with shared hosting.

   3. Select your preferred shared hosting plan. We recommend you go with
   the basic plan for now.
   Bluehost's pricing table.

   Select the basic shared hosting plan.

   4. The next page prompts you to select a domain name and domain name
   extension for your blog — the fun (sometimes frustrating) part of the
   whole experience. Click next once you’re done.
   Domain name.

   Enter a domain name.

   5. Once you select a domain name that you like and is available, you’ll
   see a verification message on the next page notifying you that the
   domain is available and you can advance to the next step.

   6. On the same page, you’ll see an account information form that
   requires you to fill out your personal details.
   Bluehost form.

   Fill in your account information.

   7. Once you’ve filled out your account information details, you’ll be
   prompted to select/deselect options for your package in the package
   information form.
   Package information form.

   Tick all the features you’d like to opt for.

   Let’s quickly review the options you can select to enhance the
   functionality and security of your brand new blogging site:
     * Constant Contact. Constant Contact is one of the best tools to
       connect with your audience without hassle. It allows you to create,
       send, and track emails and newsletters to your readership. This
       isn’t mandatory, but if you think that you’ll be sending emails to
       your subscribers regularly then go for it!
     * Domain Privacy Protection. A domain name’s whois information is
       available for anyone to acquire on the Internet. Most of the time,
       marketing companies leverage this information and send a ton of
       unwanted solicitations your way. By selecting this option, the only
       visible information will be Bluehost thus preventing your whois
       information from being publicly available.
     * Site Backup Pro. This feature takes automatic backups of your blog
       regularly. I would strongly recommend that you leave this box
       ticked. Choosing to opt out would mean that you’d have to take
       manual backups using a plugin.
     * Search Engine Jumpstart. Since you’re just starting out with your
       blog, you can leave this box un-ticked. There’s no reason to start
       worrying about search engines just yet.
     * SiteLock Security — Find. This feature isn’t compulsory but it adds
       an additional layer of security to your blogging site. Check out
       the features it offers to determine if it’s right for you.

   Leaving the default options as they are is perfectly fine, too.

   8. The billing information form requires you to fill in your credit
   card number to complete the transaction.
    1. Bluehost accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
    2. Clicking on the More payment options link enables you to pay
       through your PayPal account.

   Billing information form.

   Enter your credit card information to complete the transaction.
    1. Once you’ve filled in your billing information, tick I confirm I
       have read and agree to the Terms of Service… box and click the
       submit button.

   Submit button to complete transaction.

   Click the submit button once you’ve filled out the forms.

   By now your hosting service and domain name are paid for. In the
   following steps, we’ll login to the Bluehost cPanel and use its 1-click
   WordPress install feature to install the CMS to our blog site.

   9. Using the login details emailed to you by Bluehost, sign in to the
   Bluehost cPanel.

   10. Under the website section on the homepage, click the Install
   WordPress button.
   Bluehost's cPanel.

   1-click WordPress install in Bluehost’s cPanel.

   11. You will be redirected to a new page with information about
   WordPress. Click the green Install button to continue with the
   installation.
   Green install button to complete WordPress installation.

   Click Install to proceed.

   12. On the next screen, select your newly registered domain name (it
   should be selected by default) to let the system know which directory
   you’d like to install WordPress to. Click Check Domain once you’re
   done.
   Selecting installation folder.

   Select your blog’s domain name from the drop-down menu.

   13. All that’s left is to enter your site’s name, your admin username,
   and a password in the next screen and you’re good to go! Click Install
   Now after filling out the form.
   Install button to initiate WordPress installation.

   Click Install!

   Note: Be sure to save your admin username and password in a text file.
   You’ll login to your blog using these credentials.

   Congratulations! By now you’ve successfully:
     * Registered a domain name.
     * Purchased web hosting for your blog.
     * Installed WordPress to your blog.

   14. Login to your blog site by clicking on the Admin URL that looks
   something like http://myblogname.com/wp-admin.
   WordPress Dashboard.

   Your WordPress Dashboard should look something like this.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 4

Customize Your Blog

   In this section, I’ll introduce you to the WordPress Dashboard and help
   you install a theme to increase your blog’s visual appeal.

An Introduction to the WordPress Dashboard

   The WordPress Dashboard can be quite overwhelming for first-time users
   but I promise you’ll get used to it sooner than you think. For the
   purpose of this post, I’ll cover the following items:
     * Activating a Theme
     * Writing Your First Post
     * Exploring the Media Library
     * Adding a User

   Sounds good? Let’s get started.

Activating a Theme

   We’ll start out by installing and activating a WordPress theme to our
   blog. By default, WordPress has its default theme activated (Twenty
   Sixteen as of this writing). We’re going to change the default theme to
   a more sophisticated and contemporary theme designed specifically for
   blogging sites. Enter Activello.

   Activello is a simple, multipurpose blog theme for WordPress designed
   by our exceptionally talented team. It’s got all the right features to
   get you started with a professional and modern-looking blog. Best of
   all it’s free! You can download it from here.
   Install Activello theme

   Upload the theme’s .zip file and click Install Now.
    1. From your WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Appearance menu item
       and click on Themes in the sub-menu. (Appearance > Themes)
    2. Once you’re at the Themes window, click the Add New button at the
       top
    3. Click the Upload Theme button and upload the theme’s .zip file.
    4. Once it’s uploaded, click Install Now.
    5. You will be redirected to a screen that notifies you of the status
       of the installation. Click the Activate link once the theme is
       successfully installed.

   You can leave it be or tweak it if you’d like to change a design aspect
   by navigating to Appearance > Customize. If you’re thinking of setting
   up a niche-specific blog then be sure to check out our complete
   collection of WordPress themes.

Writing Your First Post

   As a blogger, you’ll be writing a ton of posts so it’s important that
   you pay attention to this section to get the basics down.
   Adding a post.

   Post-ception!
    1. Hover over the Posts menu item and click Add New. (Posts > Add New)
    2. You’ll be redirected to the Add New Post screen which looks
       something like this:
    3. Add a suitable title in the text box that says Enter title here.
    4. In the big text editor below, add your post’s content. You’ll find
       that there’s a handy dandy toolbar embedded inside to help you
       format your post.
    5. Click the Publish button once you’re done.

   Voila! The post is published to your blog and everyone can see it now.
   How easy was that?

Exploring the Media Library

   The WordPress Media Library is a powerful tool that you can leverage to
   handle practically all of your media management. It stores all media
   files (images, videos, audio, and documents) that you upload to your
   WordPress blog regardless of whether it’s published or not.
   WordPress Media Library.

   The powerful Media Library.
    1. Click the Media menu item from the WordPress Dashboard.
    2. You will be redirected to the Media Library screen from where you
       can manage all of your media files.
    3. Click the Add New button at the top of the screen.
    4. Select a media item from your drive and upload it.
    5. The media item will be added to your Media Library and you can
       embed it in posts and pages now.

   The Media Library also lets you edit images from within WordPress —
   cropping, resizing, scaling – you name it. A blog post isn’t complete
   without a few relevant images to go with it!

Adding a User

   Seeing that you’re a dedicated blogger and are in high hopes of taking
   your blogging site to better frontiers (after all, you have made it
   this far down the post), there will come a time when you’ll need some
   outside help or in other words, you’ll want to outsource some of your
   work.

   Whether it’s to manage the technical side of your website or to add a
   few regular authors to your team, the best way to go about it is to add
   user accounts. WordPress enables admins to add users to their site
   which allows them restricted access to the blog’s back end (depending
   upon the user’s role).
   Add New User form.

   Fill out the Add New User form and select a user role.
    1. On the WordPress Dashboard, hover over Users and click Add New.
       (Users > Add New)
    2. The Add New User screen will appear and you will be prompted to add
       some personal details of the user you intend to add.
    3. Once you’ve filled out the details, select a user role from the
       drop-down menu e.g. Admin, Author, Editor, etc.
    4. Click Add New User.

   Your new user will be added to your site and they’ll receive an
   automated email containing their login information.
     __________________________________________________________________

Step 5

Add Useful Plugins

   Want to add a new feature to your blog? There’s a plugin for that!
   Plugins are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already
   exists in WordPress.

   Plugins can be thought of as tiny apps that enhance your blog’s
   functionality. WordPress has a ton of plugins, both free and premium,
   for you to select from. In fact, there’s a whole official WordPress
   Repository full of freebies that you should definitely check out.

How to Add Plugins

   Adding plugins to your WordPress blog is quite simple.
   Add New Plugin screen.

   Adding plugins to enhance functionality.
    1. Navigate to the WordPress Dashboard, hover over the Plugins menu
       item and click Add New. (Plugins > Add New)
    2. On the Add Plugins screen, you’ll find that you can upload plugins
       or search for free plugins using the search box located in the
       top-right corner of the screen.
    3. Once you’ve selected a plugin to install, click the Install Now
       button.
    4. Activate the plugin after it’s been installed.

   Installing plugins is quite unchallenging and after tinkering with
   their settings you can start using them immediately.

A Word to the Wise

   Take it from a plugin hoarder, it’s very easy to become addicted to
   installing and storing plugins to your blog site. I mean they’re so
   cool and there’s so many of them and they do so many cool things.

   One thing you need to remember is that you don’t have unlimited space
   on your server. Now 50 GB is more than enough to get your blog off the
   ground but it’s not enough for you to store hundreds of activated
   plugins on. I strongly suggest that you evaluate your blog’s needs and
   make a list of the most essential plugins it requires to deliver value
   to your readership.

   Instead of getting labeled as a plugin hoarder like me, thoroughly
   assess your desire every time you get the itch to install a new plugin.
   Believe me, it’ll save you a ton of space and your blog won’t slow
   down.

Some Essential Plugins

   Having said all of that, there are some plugins that you should install
   without question.
     * A contact form plugin — Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms both work
       great.
     * A caching plugin — I’d recommend W3 Total Cache; it’s blazing fast!
     * An SEO plugin — Yoast SEO is hands down the best SEO plugin. There
       really is no competition.
     * Kiwi Social Sharing WordPress Plugin — Kiwi gives you tons of
       options and it’s super easy to use.
     * The Jetpack plugin — you can activate / deactivate its modules as
       per your requirement.

   Without a doubt, these plugins are essential to running a successful
   blog and you can install most of them free of charge. Fore more useful
   pluguins you can read our essential WordPress plugin guide.

Wrapping It Up

   There’s definitely a lot more to blogging than what this guide covers.
   Hopefully, we’ve provided you with enough information to get started
   with setting up your very own WordPress blog from scratch. We encourage
   you to explore WordPress further and leverage the powerful content
   management system to its full potential.
