Britons indulge in surprise pre-Brexit house buying spree

   This article is more than 1 month old

   Buyers looking to complete deals before 31 October, says property site
   Rightmove

   British house hunters have launched a surprise August buying spree
   before the scheduled Brexit date, with new data showing sales reached
   their highest point since 2015 during the usually sleepy summer period.

   The number of agreed sales rose by 6.1% year on year in the month to 10
   August, according to property website Rightmove, which claims to track
   nine in 10 UK house purchases.

   House prices in the UK have mostly risen constantly since April 2012,
   according to the Office for National Statistics, but the pace of growth
   has collapsed since the June 2016 Brexit vote, from an annual rate of
   8.2% to only 0.9% in June 2019.

   London and the south of England have registered price drops in recent
   months and housing market economists have highlighted the effect of
   Brexit uncertainty, as buyers hold out for the political chaos to
   subside before making long-term decisions.

   However, Miles Shipside, a director at Rightmove, said the latest
   figures suggest buyers are now looking to complete deals ahead of the
   latest Brexit deadline at the end of October.

   “Whilst another approaching Brexit deadline is now nothing new for
   prospective buyers, this one may seem more definite, and therefore one
   to beat, with the government regarding this one as ‘do or die’,” he
   said.

   “While the end of October Brexit outcome remains uncertain, more buyers
   are now going for the certainty of doing a deal, with some having
   perhaps hesitated earlier in the year.”

   Historically low mortgage rates, amid intense competition among lenders
   to sign up new borrowers, have added to the incentive to push through
   purchases in short order, he added.

   “There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial,
   financial and emotional forces driving the need to move, and with the
   average time between agreeing a sale and moving in being more than
   three months, we’re now entering the last chance saloon for those who
   want to have finished their move before the end of the year,” said
   Shipside.

   “We often see an autumn activity bounce, but perhaps this year’s
   political activities have brought that forward into a summer surge as
   buyers have gone bolder and earlier than usual.”

   Glynis Frew, the chief executive of estate agent Hunters, said the
   volume of house sales was also fuelled by sellers keen to get deals
   done.

   “Many vendors at this moment in time seem happy to demand slightly
   lower asking prices if it means they can get the deal out the door as
   quickly as possible in light of the ongoing Brexit uncertainty,” she
   said.

   The rise in the volume of sales was felt in every part of the country
   but was most pronounced in the north-east and the east of England, and
   Yorkshire & the Humber, with rises of over 10%.

   The average price of properties coming on to the market in the month to
   10 August fell by £3,192 compared to the previous month, to £305,500.
   That represented a 1% decrease, but prices remained 1.2% higher than
   the same month last year.

BBC using strong-arm tactics over iPlayer, say independent producers

   Small TV companies claim BBC trying to get them to lease shows for

   The BBC has been accused of trying to strong-arm independent TV
   producers into extending the availability of their shows on the iPlayer
   from 30 days to one year without paying millions in additional
   licensing fees.

   Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, this month gave the green light for
   the biggest expansion of the BBC iPlayer since its launch in 2007, to
   enable the corporation to fight back in the streaming war against
   Netflix and Amazon.

   Independent TV producers argue that keeping their shows exclusively on
   iPlayer longer means that they are less valuable when they are
   eventually allowed to be sold on to other services, such as Netflix or
   other buyers, which they are currently allowed to do 18 months after
   they have aired on the BBC.

   Recognising this financial issue, Ofcom has said the BBC needs to
   “adequately compensate” producers and that it may have to look to pay a
   higher price for programming.

   However, Pact, the body representing the multibillion-pound UK
   independent TV production industry, says it has been repeatedly
   contacted by members reporting that the BBC is trying to get them to
   sign off on using their shows for longer on the iPlayer without paying
   more.

   Pact says the tactics started in April, when the BBC’s proposal to
   extend iPlayer viewing rights to a year were first made public, and has
   prompted it to take the step of warning its entire member base about
   the issue.

   “The BBC has consistently sought to strong-arm suppliers into giving
   the BBC these rights for no compensation and without a proper
   agreement,” said John McVay, Pact’s chief executive. “Pact has warned
   its members three times since April that the BBC has not yet reached an
   agreement with Pact for its ambitious plans.”

   In addition, the BBC is also planning a huge expansion of the iPlayer
   to make programmes available on the service for up to five years in
   total.

   Proposals to do this were not part of Ofcom’s assessment, which has
   agreed to allow only children’s content to be made available on the
   iPlayer exclusively for five years, as the corporation wants to keep
   shows for a further four years on a non-exclusive basis.

   According to production company executives, the BBC is offering a
   pittance for deals offering a further two packages of streaming rights
   to programmes lasting two years each – after they have been exclusively
   on the iPlayer for a year – to keep shows on the service.

   “The proposed payment structure for these periods is risible,” said one
   senior production industry executive. “Having shows effectively
   permanently available on the iPlayer will depress the price that anyone
   else will want to pay for it.”

   The BBC has also been accused of trying to give BritBox, its joint
   venture subscription streaming service with ITV due to launch this
   year, an advantage by being first in line to pick up shows after they
   leave the iPlayer, instead of services such as Netflix.

   Following the end of the one-year exclusivity window on iPlayer, the
   BBC is proposing that shows then only be allowed to be sold to a
   platform or broadcaster that “invests in and supports the UK creative
   industries” that also agrees to carry “prominent and approved” BBC
   branding and provide audience performance data. If producers want to
   wait to sell to anyone they like, they can do so only after 18 months,
   under the BBC plan.

   This has been viewed by the production industry as attempting to
   eliminate Netflix as a bidder for shows once they are first allowed to
   be sold beyond the iPlayer.

   Netflix prefers to brand shows it buys the rights to as its own in
   international markets – the BBC’s Bodyguard was known as a Netflix
   Original outside the UK – and is secretive about sharing any data on
   the popularity of shows on its platform.

   One production industry source said: “You could have a situation where
   a programme is being broadcast on TV by the BBC for free, is on the
   iPlayer for free but also on BritBox where you would have to pay for
   it.”

   Ofcom has said the extension of iPlayer rights to a year will have an
   “adverse impact” on the launch of BritBox, but ITV has dismissed those
   concerns and did not object to the BBC’s plans.

   However, Ofcom has estimated that the increase in viewing of BBC
   iPlayer content will mean an audience reduction at Channel 4’s All4,
   ITV’s ITV Hub and Channel 5’s My5 and other online platforms. The loss
   of advertising revenue as a result is estimated at almost £15m next
   year, although Channel 4 says it will be higher, with Ofcom estimating
   that losses will grow in subsequent years.

   “Both viewers and production companies win by making programmes
   available for longer on BBC iPlayer,” said a BBC spokesman. “This is
   about keeping up with viewer expectations and is long overdue.
   Audiences are choosing to consume content on demand and the value they
   receive from their licence fee should reflect that shift.

   “We continue to have conversations with Pact and production companies
   to make this happen. Longer BBC iPlayer availability does not reduce
   the opportunities for them commercially, rather, success on the BBC
   leads to commercial success for independently produced programmes.”

   The UK’s privacy watchdog has opened an investigation into the use of
   facial recognition cameras in a busy part of central London.

   The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, announced she would
   look into the technology being used in Granary Square, close to King’s
   Cross station.

   Two days ago the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, wrote to the
   development’s owner demanding to know whether the company believed its
   use of facial recognition software in its CCTV systems was legal.

   The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said it was “deeply
   concerned about the growing use of facial recognition technology in
   public spaces” and was seeking detailed information about how it is
   used.

   “Scanning people’s faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives in
   order to identify them is a potential threat to privacy that should
   concern us all,” Denham said. “That is especially the case if it is
   done without people’s knowledge or understanding.

   “My office and the judiciary are both independently considering the
   legal issues and whether the current framework has kept pace with
   emerging technologies and people’s expectations about how their most
   sensitive personal data is used.

   “We have launched an investigation following concerns reported in the
   media regarding the use of live facial recognition in the King’s Cross
   area of central London, which thousands of people pass through every
   day.”

   She added: “As well as requiring detailed information from the relevant
   organisations about how the technology is used, we will also inspect
   the system and its operation onsite to assess whether or not it
   complies with data protection law.”

   On Monday the development’s owners confirmed facial recognition
   software was being used around the 67-acre, 50-building site.

   The consortium of Argent, a property developer, Hermes Investment
   Management, on behalf of BT Pensioners, and AustralianSuper, an
   Australian pension scheme, said they were doing so “in the interest of
   public safety and to ensure that everyone who visits has the best
   possible experience”.

   Liberty, the human rights campaign group, has criticised the use of the
   technology as a “disturbing expansion of mass surveillance that
   threatens our privacy and freedom of expression as we go about our
   everyday lives”.

   The ICO had previously warned businesses using the surveillance
   technology that they needed to demonstrate that its use is “strictly
   necessary and proportionate” and has a clear basis in law.

   Last month the House of Commons science and technology committee
   suggested authorities cease trials of such technology until a legal
   framework was established.

   In a report on the government’s approach to biometrics and forensics,
   the MPs referred to automatic facial recognition testing carried out by
   the Metropolitan police and South Wales police.

   They noted that an evaluation of both trials by the Biometrics and
   Forensics Ethics Group raised questions about accuracy and bias.
   Concerns were also raised that police custody images of individuals not
   convicted of any crime were not being deleted.

New chapter? UK print book sales fall while audiobooks surge 43%

   Publishers hit by surprise 5.4% fall in 2018 – but warn against
   proclaiming terminal decline

   UK book sales fell for the first time in five years in 2018, despite
   the success of bestsellers such as Michelle Obama’s autobiography,
   Becoming.

   The UK publishing industry was hit by a surprise fall of £168m (5.4%)
   in sales of physical books last year, ending a period of growth
   stretching back to at least 2014.

   Sales fell from £3.11bn in 2017 to £2.95bn last year, according to the
   latest figures from the Publishers Association, which published its
   annual yearbook on Wednesday.

   Audiobook sales surged 43% to £69m last year, with Amazon’s Audible
   service dominating sales. However, Stephen Lotinga, the chief executive
   of the Publishers Association, said this was not the sole reason for
   the decline in print sales.

   “One of the biggest changes has been the increase in audiobook sales,”
   said Lotinga. “There is some substitution away from print, audio has
   surged, but there was also always going to be a point where print sales
   couldn’t continue rising every year.”

   Some of the biggest hits last year included Michelle Obama’s Becoming,
   published in print and as an audiobook, which is on its way to becoming
   the most successful memoir in modern publishing history.

   Other big sellers included Joe Wicks’s The Fat-Loss Plan: 100 Quick and
   Easy Recipes with Workouts, Michael Wolff’s White House exposé Fire and
   Fury and John Grisham’s The Rooster Bar.

   Lotinga said the rise in the popularity of podcasts, with the music
   streaming giant Spotify spending up to $500m this year buying podcast
   companies to tap the boom, was indirectly helping the book market.

   “We think that podcasting is helping to drive a resurgence in audio in
   general, including books,” he said. “Publishers are investing a huge
   amount in building [recording] studios and securing the services of top
   quality actors to voice the books. We think the whole audio scene is
   showing huge opportunity.”

   However, he warned against pronouncing the beginning of a terminal
   decline in physical book sales in the same way the music industry has
   experienced with the move from CD to streaming in the last decade.

   Sales of printed books still accounted for over 80% of the combined
   print and digital UK book market of £3.6bn last year.

   Overall, the digital book market, which as well as audiobooks includes
   ebook sales and subscriptions to services such as Amazon’s Kindle
   Unlimited, rose 4.6% to £653m.

   “I’m not concerned that this could be a watershed moment for the
   printed book, we are not there yet,” said Lotinga. “We have not seen a
   huge shift into subscription services, piracy is low, people still love
   physical books. It is a trend halt, sales are still up 8% over the last
   five years.”

   Consumer ebook sales continued their slow decline, down 2% to £251m.
   Sales have fallen 20% since 2014 as rising competition for screen time
   from services such as Netflix, Facebook and YouTube continues to eat
   away at the popularity of ebooks and ereaders.

   Total sales of UK-published books domestically and overseas, including
   income from print and digital journals, academic and reference books,
   rose 2% to £6bn last year.

What is prorogation?

   Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament,
   normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a
   new Queen’s speech. It means parliament’s sitting is suspended and it
   ends all current legislation under discussion.

   It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary
   session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.

So is this just normal procedure?

   There are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For
   prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times.
   For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than
   a week.

   However, the five-week suspension does include a three-week period that
   would typically be recess anyway, three weeks during which the Liberal
   Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held.

   The length of the prorogation will clearly have the effect of narrowing
   rebel MPs’ options – they have two weeks fewer in parliament to pass
   any anti-no-deal legislation.

Why does Boris Johnson say he is doing this?

   Johnson has rejected claims his decision is designed to block MPs from
   considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of
   mounting a “coup” against parliament. No 10 said there would be “ample
   time” for MPs to debate Brexit either side of the EU summit on 17
   October.

   He says the move will allow him to “bring forward an ambitious new
   legislative programme for MPs’ approval”.

Can MPs vote against prorogation?

   No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in
   the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would
   vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However,
   proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in
   this way.

How does the privy council come into this?

   The request to the Queen and the proposed timetable was made at a privy
   council meeting at Balmoral by a small number of senior ministers who
   attend the meetings.

   There has been some confusion because technically senior opposition MPs
   are members of the privy council, including Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour
   leader. But these MPs do not go to actual meetings, that is the
   preserve of a select number of senior ministers, led by Jacob
   Rees-Mogg, who is the lord president of the council.

Could the Queen have refused the privy council’s request?

   Technically, yes under the royal prerogative. But in reality it would
   have been extremely difficult for her to do so. Corbyn has written to
   her saying that “there was a danger that the royal prerogative is being
   set directly against the wishes of a majority of the House of Commons”.

How will this affect plans to stop no deal?

   Less than 24 hours after Corbyn and other opposition MPs came to an
   agreement that they would use legislative efforts to stop no deal,
   rather than the “nuclear option” of an immediate no-confidence vote, it
   looks like the window for potential legislation has become far
   narrower.

   It makes the prospect of a snap no-confidence vote far more likely and
   remainer MPs will need to weigh up that option again. Corbyn has
   offered to lead a caretaker government to negotiate an extension to
   article 50 and then call a general election – an offer that is highly
   unpalatable to most Conservative MPs.

   The Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he
   would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days before
   parliament’s return next week.

   Grieve said a no-confidence vote was now more likely. “If it is
   impossible to prevent prorogation then I think it is going to be very
   difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government
   and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to
   table a motion for a vote of no confidence,” he said.

Will there be legal action to stop prorogation?

   There will certainly be an attempt. The campaigner Gina Miller revealed
   on Wednesday evening that her lawyers had made an urgent application to
   the high court for a judicial review of Boris Johnson’s plan to
   prorogue parliament.

   The SNP MP Joanna Cherry has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal
   team about speeding up the planned action in the Scottish courts, which
   was due to be heard on 6 September.

   Labour’s Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70
   MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an
   interim interdict – similar to an injunction in England and Wales – in
   the court of session to block prorogation.

   Led by Jolyon Maugham QC’s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking
   a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going
   to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were
   exhausted.
