Exclusive: Apple planning $4.99/month price for Arcade game subscription

   Last Saturday, 9to5Mac got access to Apple’s early access program for
   Apple Arcade, which was announced back in March when the company held
   its special event dedicated to Services. Apple Arcade will allow iOS,
   Mac, and Apple TV users to pay a flat monthly fee and access a bundle
   of otherwise paid apps through the App Store. Now we’ve discovered that
   Apple Arcade will likely be priced at $4.99 per month.

   The early access program was being offered to Apple employees for the
   symbolic price of 49¢ per month, with a one-month free trial, until the
   end of the early access period, which was said to be when iOS 13 ships
   to customers.

   Today, I was able to get information about the price of an Apple Arcade
   subscription to customers. This information is available in one of the
   APIs used by the App Store app. According to a promotional message
   found in the service, the price for Apple Arcade will be $4.99 / month,
   including a one-month free trial. As Apple previously announced, the
   service will allow access to all members in a Family Sharing account.

   Since the price has not been officially announced yet, it’s possible
   that it will change before the announcement, which is likely going to
   on September 10, when Apple is expected to hold a special event to
   announce new iPhones.

PSA: Many major media players vulnerable to attack via malicious subtitles
files [Video]

   Ben Lovejoy

   - May. 24th 2017 7:11 am PT

   Security researchers have discovered a surprising new way for attackers
   to gain control of a machine: malicious subtitles. The vulnerability is
   device-independent, meaning it could be used to gain control of
   anything from an iPhone to a Mac.

   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]
   [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   The vulnerability was discovered by Check Point, which describes it as
   a significant risk.

     Check Point researchers revealed a new attack vector which threatens
     millions of users worldwide – attack by subtitles. By crafting
     malicious subtitle files, which are then downloaded by a victim’s
     media player, attackers can take complete control over any type of
     device via vulnerabilities found in many popular streaming
     platforms, including VLC, Kodi (XBMC), Popcorn-Time and strem.io. We
     estimate there are approximately 200 million video players and
     streamers that currently run the vulnerable software, making this
     one of the most widespread, easily accessed and zero-resistance
     vulnerability reported in recent years.

   There is no evidence that this attack vector is yet in active use, but
   now that the possibility has been disclosed, it’s likely only a matter
   of time before the bad guys figure out the details and start using it.

   Check Point said that the vulnerable code was found in many major media
   players, including VLC, Kodi, Stremio & PopcornTime. There are fixes
   available for all but Kodi, where the source code has been fixed but a
   runtime version is not yet available.
     * PopcornTime– Created a Fixed version, however it is not yet
       available to download in the official website. The fixed version
       can be manually downloaded via the following
       link: https://ci.popcorntime.sh/job/Popcorn-Time-Desktop/249
     * Kodi– Created a fix version, which is currently only available as
       source code release. This version is not yet available to download
       in the official site. Link to the source code fix is available
       here: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12024
     * VLC– Officially fixed and available to download on their website
       Link: http://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.5.1/win32/vlc-2.2.5.1-win32.e
       xe
     * Stremio– Officially Fixed and avilable to download on their website
       Link: https://www.strem.io/

   The firm has put together a proof of concept based on a Windows
   machine, but stresses that all devices are vulnerable. While malware
   remains a relatively small problem for Apple users, it is not a risk
   which can be completely ignored.

Exclusive: Apple planning $4.99/month price for Arcade game subscription
service after free trial, works with Family Sharing

   Last Saturday, 9to5Mac got access to Apple’s early access program for
   Apple Arcade, which was announced back in March when the company held
   its special event dedicated to Services. Apple Arcade will allow iOS,
   Mac, and Apple TV users to pay a flat monthly fee and access a bundle
   of otherwise paid apps through the App Store. Now we’ve discovered that
   Apple Arcade will likely be priced at $4.99 per month.

   The early access program was being offered to Apple employees for the
   symbolic price of 49¢ per month, with a one-month free trial, until the
   end of the early access period, which was said to be when iOS 13 ships
   to customers.

   Today, I was able to get information about the price of an Apple Arcade
   subscription to customers. This information is available in one of the
   APIs used by the App Store app. According to a promotional message
   found in the service, the price for Apple Arcade will be $4.99 / month,
   including a one-month free trial. As Apple previously announced, the
   service will allow access to all members in a Family Sharing account.

   Since the price has not been officially announced yet, it’s possible
   that it will change before the announcement, which is likely going to
   on September 10, when Apple is expected to hold a special event to
   announce new iPhones.

   Security researchers have discovered a surprising new way for attackers
   to gain control of a machine: malicious subtitles. The vulnerability is
   device-independent, meaning it could be used to gain control of
   anything from an iPhone to a Mac.

   The vulnerability was discovered by Check Point, which describes it as
   a significant risk.

     Check Point researchers revealed a new attack vector which threatens
     millions of users worldwide – attack by subtitles. By crafting
     malicious subtitle files, which are then downloaded by a victim’s
     media player, attackers can take complete control over any type of
     device via vulnerabilities found in many popular streaming
     platforms, including VLC, Kodi (XBMC), Popcorn-Time and strem.io. We
     estimate there are approximately 200 million video players and
     streamers that currently run the vulnerable software, making this
     one of the most widespread, easily accessed and zero-resistance
     vulnerability reported in recent years.

   There is no evidence that this attack vector is yet in active use, but
   now that the possibility has been disclosed, it’s likely only a matter
   of time before the bad guys figure out the details and start using it.

   Check Point said that the vulnerable code was found in many major media
   players, including VLC, Kodi, Stremio & PopcornTime. There are fixes
   available for all but Kodi, where the source code has been fixed but a
   runtime version is not yet available.
     * PopcornTime– Created a Fixed version, however it is not yet
       available to download in the official website. The fixed version
       can be manually downloaded via the following
       link: https://ci.popcorntime.sh/job/Popcorn-Time-Desktop/249
     * Kodi– Created a fix version, which is currently only available as
       source code release. This version is not yet available to download
       in the official site. Link to the source code fix is available
       here: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12024
     * VLC– Officially fixed and available to download on their website
       Link: http://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.5.1/win32/vlc-2.2.5.1-win32.e
       xe
     * Stremio– Officially Fixed and avilable to download on their website
       Link: https://www.strem.io/

   The firm has put together a proof of concept based on a Windows
   machine, but stresses that all devices are vulnerable. While malware
   remains a relatively small problem for Apple users, it is not a risk
   which can be completely ignored.
