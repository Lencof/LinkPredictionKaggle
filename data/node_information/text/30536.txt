A new source of leverage: seeding start-ups from their initial idea

   IT-Translation is an investor and co-founder of digital technology
   start-ups spun off from both public and private research. What makes
   our business model so unique? We seed start-ups from ideas: we jointly
   set up the business and provide – at a very early stage - an investment
   of up to 300,000 euros through the IT-Translation fund.

   We look at the creation of start-ups through an approach based on
   ’translation’: we deploy our human and financial resources to
   ‘translate’ the technology into products or services, and to lead the
   researcher/entrepreneur into the business world. IT-Translation invests
   its money and its efforts in start-ups, working together with all
   innovation stakeholders. Early 2015, four years after IT-Translation
   got under way, more than 25 start-ups have been incorporated.

INVESTING & COFOUNDING

   We invest while leave the majority shareholding to the founders

   IT-Translation, as a founding partner, takes a 15% stake at company
   incorporation time. Our team work together with founders to develop a
   sound and viable plan which will raise interest from other early-stage
   investors in the digital sector.

   IT-Translation commits to invest 300,000 euros as soon as this business
   plan is written, typically within a period of six to nine months. We
   take part in raising the capital needed, which may increase
   IT-Translation’s stake to as much as 30%. This round also triggers
   leveraged loans, allowing a total financing amount of up to one million
   euros.

   Start-ups have a partner from the beginning

   As a co-founder, IT-Translation is the start-up’s first business
   associate: a dedicated partner in our team is involved in the every day
   development of the business. The partner works on an ongoing basis,
   offering a wide range of tools and methodologies which suit the pace
   and needs of the business leaders. He is a resource to help translate
   the technology into a product (finding usages and product/market fit),
   and to lead the researchers into the world of business (building the
   business plan, contributing to the company’s organization and providing
   operational support).
   Beside the partner, all our team members may contribute on demand with
   their ideas, their experience, their network or their fresh view of the
   business.. As a team, we bring a strong mix of industry,
   entrepreneurship & research knowledge, experience and culture.
   Decisions are taken in close cooperation at each stage.

As a researcher in digital technology, do you want to set up a business, or
have you just done so?

Our commitment to promote French research

   Companies on the leading edge of technology create high added-value
   products; which have a central role to play in the development of the
   digital world.

   IT-Translation’s mission is to help establish and grow French companies
   which are capable of unlocking this great technological potential, of
   generating high-level jobs and of becoming leaders in their markets.
   Our approach responds to the need to create value from public and
   private-sector research: it places technology at the heart of the value
   proposition, and enables researchers to obtain sufficiently early
   funding to transform their cutting-edge technologies into products and
   services which are innovative and marketable.
