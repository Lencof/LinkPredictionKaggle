Comments to the White House Inquiry on Public Access to Publicly Funded
Research Publications, Data

   Timothy Vollmer

Timothy Vollmer

   January 13, 2012

   In November we wrote that the White House Office of Science and
   Technology Policy (OSTP) was soliciting comments on two related
   Requests for Information (RFI). One asked for feedback on how the
   federal government should manage public access to scholarly
   publications resulting from federal investments, and the other wanted
   input on public access to the digital data funded by federal tax
   dollars.

   Creative Commons submitted a response to both RFIs. Below is a brief
   summary of the main points. Several other groups and individuals have
   submitted responses to OSTP, and all the comments will eventually be
   made available on the OSTP website.

   Response to Publications RFI
     * The public funds tens of billions of dollars in research each year.
       The federal government can support scientific innovation,
       productivity, and economic efficiency of the taxpayer dollars they
       expend by instituting an open licensing policy.
     * Scholarly articles created as a result of federally funded research
       should be released under full open access. Full open access
       policies will provide to the public immediate, free-of-cost online
       availability to federally funded research without restriction
       except that attribution be given to the source.
     * The standard means for granting permission to the public aligned
       with full open access is through a Creative Commons Attribution (CC
       BY) license.

   Response to Data RFI
     * If the federal government wants to maximize the impact of digital
       data resulting from federally funded scientific research, it should
       provide explicit, easy-to-understand information about the rights
       available to the public.
     * The federal government should establish policies that insure the
       public has cost-free, unimpeded access to the digital data
       resulting from federally funded scientific research. Access to this
       data should be made available as soon as possible, with due
       consideration to confidentiality and privacy issues, as well as the
       researchers’ need to receive credit and benefit from the work.
     * The federal government can grant these permissions to the public by
       supporting policies whereby 1) data is made available by dedicating
       it to the public domain or 2) data is made available through a
       liberal license where at most downstream data users must give
       credit to the source of the data. CC offers tools such as the CC0
       waiver and CC BY license in support of these goals.
