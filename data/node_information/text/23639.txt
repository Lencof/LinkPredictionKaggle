About The Cover

   Cover image expansion

   ONLINE COVER Small Particles, Big Implications. Micronutrient
   deficiencies contribute to impaired growth and disease and are a
   leading public health concern in the developing world. This image
   illustrates encapsulated micronutrient release in the stomach for
   absorption in the intestine. To improve oral micronutrient delivery,
   Anselmo et al. formulated heat-stable polymeric microparticles that
   encapsulated 11 micronutrients, including vitamins A, B2, B12, and
   iron. Encapsulation stabilized micronutrients against degradation
   induced by boiling water or cooking and other environmental conditions.
   The authors performed two clinical trials and experiments in rodents
   and an in vitro human intestinal tissue model to optimize microparticle
   formulations, improving iron loading, stability during cooking, and
   bioavailability while allowing for scale-up. This microparticle
   platform could help improve oral delivery of micronutrients. [CREDIT:
