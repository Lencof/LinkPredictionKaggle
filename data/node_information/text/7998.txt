   5dfa6bd89460947573c61613a3058a2d2c028e] Barsys

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

Google may have taken a step towards quantum computing 'supremacy'

   Or maybe not -- the paper has been unpublished and its results are
   disputed.

   Barsys $1,500 robot bartender promises cocktails with AI precision
   You can control the home bar with up to three devices at a time.
   Christine Fisher, 07.18.19

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

   Barsys $1,500 robot bartender promises cocktails with AI precision
   You can control the home bar with up to three devices at a time.
   Christine Fisher, 07.18.19

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.

   The "Keurig of cocktails" concept isn't exactly new, but that's not
   stopping companies like Barsys from perfecting the robotic bartender.
   Next week, Barsys is launching its robotic cocktail mixer 2.0. Like the
   original, the next iteration offers automated cocktails and
   customizable drink recipes. But now, you'll be able to control the
   machine with up to three devices at a time, thanks to Bluetooth. And
   Barsys 2.0 will use AI to keep drinks consistent.

   That convenience will cost you. Barsys 2.0 will be available July 22nd
   for $1,500. That's quite a jump from competitors like Drinkworks, which
   offers its Home Bar for $299. But the company is hoping Barsys 2.0
   might also appeal to bars and restaurants. It claims Barsys 2.0 could
   reduce waste with exact pours, and while it doesn't exactly want to
   replace bartenders, it wouldn't mind "freeing them up" to interact with
   customers.
