New Report: Who is behind the wheel? Fixing the global standards on company

هل سيشعل الفساد المستشري فتيل الخريف العربي؟

   خلال الشهرين الماضيين، اجتاحت موجة من الاحتجاجات شوارع مصر والعراق
   ولبنان. وبلغ عدد المحتجين الذين نزلوا إلى الشوارع في لبنان أكثر من
   مليون شخص ينددون بالظلم، وكان ذلك غالبا في تحدّ للقمع العنيف الذي
   تمارسه السلطات. وعلى الرغم من اختلاف المطالب التي نادى بها المحتجون في
   البلدان الثلاثة، بل تختلف حتى فيما بين الحركات في نفس البلد، إلا أن هذا
   الغضب العارم قام على قاسم مشترك بينها: الفساد وسوء الإدارة المالية
   للحكومات.

Right to information: a tool for people power

   Globally, approximately 120 countries have right to information laws.
   In some countries, these laws are top notch, but in others, the laws
