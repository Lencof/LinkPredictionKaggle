   Robby Hecht sings like a whisper, like a hesitant truth that simply
   can’t go unsung anymore. His songs can invoke starry nights and fog
   rolling in on the beach.
   Lights turning off. Front porch silences and morning walks alone.
   Holding hands for the first time, letting go for the last. Across his
   three indie releases, Hecht has distinguished himself as the second
   coming of James Taylor, a gentler Damien Jurado. But, whatever the
   comparison, it’s hard to miss that his songwriting is distinct and
   individual. He doesn’t shy from the obvious rhyme, but manages it with
   a delicate audacity, placing it only where it best serves the story or
   the mood. And, there’s something about the way he unfurls a line that
   feels less like trying to work something out and more like just calling
   it what it is. -Kim Ruehl, No Depression
