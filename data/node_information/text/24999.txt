Empowering Sophisticated Programmatic Strategies

   “We’ve shown that consumers that engage with a playable ad have a
   whopping 95% brand message recall. It’s hard to beat that in the mobile
   environment. Beeswax’s system is optimized for mobile. None of the
   other DSPs work as seamlessly in a fast-changing environment.”

   “Beeswax gave us the power and control we felt was lacking from other
   solutions in the marketplace. Specifically, Beeswax allowed us to
   customize an in-house solution empowered by our proprietary analytics
   and technology capabilities. We were able to meet our campaign
   objectives while also having full transparency of our costs, results,
   and underlying data. The process was easy, and the results were
   tremendous.”

   “From the very beginning, Beeswax has gone well beyond the call to make
   sure we were getting what we need throughout the development and
   testing process. As we add to our roadmap, Beeswax gives us the support
   to get the tech right and ensure we will continually be successful and
   consistently meet our goals. Previously, we were at the mercy of the
   very high-level, non-strategic data most DSPs deliver to their clients.
   But with Beeswax, we have the insights that drive our business.”

   “This integration enables sales teams to automate the booking of media
   buys and execution of orders across owned and acquired inventory. With
   this partnership we can showcase the business value of increased
   efficiencies and reduced complexity across the ever-expanding number of
   execution channels that Media Companies operate in.”

   “One of the primary reasons iotec decided to work with Beeswax is
   because of its ability to help us focus and develop one of our core
   unique selling points -- the machine learning technology. The quality
   of integrations Beeswax has in place, their easy-to-use UI, and the
   infrastructure cost savings were other key determining factors. We are
   continually impressed by the Beeswax platform and its technical support
   team.”

   “Due to the nature of the Beeswax platform, we didn't have to worry
   about the tech behind the DSP. Rather, Beeswax gave us the flexibility
   to focus our efforts where we know we bring value to the online
   advertising ecosystem: data processing and bidding intelligence.”

Better Than a DSP, More Efficient Than Building One Yourself

     * Pricing
     * API / UI
     * Supply & Data
     * Data Transparency
     * Customization

   Traditional
   DSP
     * Penalizing pricing model based on % of media spend.
     * UI / API ready to use.
     * Supply and Data Integrations are limited to DSP’s standard pool.
     * Limited Data Access.
     * Restricted to standard optimization strategies.

   Build Your Own Bidder
     * Expensive and time consuming.
     * Time consuming API / UI.
     * Must create the integrations from scratch.
     * Full insight into log-level data.
     * Custom optimization, but time consuming to use.
