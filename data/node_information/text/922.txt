          + Facebook has banned a network of fake accounts that were
            trying to influence politics in Moldova.
          + The social network says the campaign had links to the Moldovan
            government.
          + Itʼs the latest example of groups using Facebook to
            nefariously meddle in domestic affairs in countries around the
            world.
       Another day, another covert campaign on Facebook to influence
       politics using fake accounts.
       The Silicon Valley social network announced on Thursday that it had
       discovered a network of hundreds and accounts and pages in
       targeting people in Moldova, in an apparent attempt to influence
       political debate and social issues in the country ahead of upcoming
       elections — and Facebook says that employees of the Moldovan
       government were involved.
       In a blog post, Facebookʼs head of cybersecurity police Nathaniel
       Gleicher said the company has "removed 168 Facebook accounts, 28
       Pages and eight Instagram accounts for engaging in coordinated
       inauthentic behavior targeting people in Moldova. This activity
       originated in Moldova, and used a combination of fake accounts and
       some authentic accounts to mislead others about who they were and
       what they were doing."
       The takedowns are the latest example of how malicious actors have
       weaponized Facebook, time and time again, to sow division and push
       political narratives. Itʼs a tactic that first drew scrutiny after
       Russia spread inflammatory disinformation and propaganda on
       Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election.
       And it indicates that Facebook, despite significant investments in
       "safety and security," has yet to eradicate these nefarious
       activities outright, and that some governments are now seemingly
       using them against their own citizens.
       In January 2019, Facebook announced it had detected a similar
       campaign being run from Iran, targeting people in numerous
       countries, from Afghanistan to France, Germany, India, Israel, the
       US, and South Africa. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously described
       the battle between Facebook and hostile actors as an "arms race,"
       with both sides fighting to stay ahead.
       Gleicher said that employees of the Moldovan government were behind
       at least some of the activity:
       "The Page admins and account owners typically posted about local
       news and political issues such as required Russian or English
       language education and reunification with Romania. They also shared
       manipulated photos, divisive narratives and satire and impersonated
       a local fact checking organization’s Page that called out other
       Pages for spreading fake news. Although the people behind this
       activity attempted to conceal their identities, our manual review
       found that some of this activity was linked to employees of the
       Moldovan government."

          + The advertising and media industries will continue to see
            seismic changes in 2019, according to a new report by market
            research firm Forrester.
          + AT&T will buy Roku and Google will acquire LiveRamp in 2019,
            Forrester predicts.
          + Additionally, blockchain will become increasingly mainstream,
            and hyper-targeting will give way to contextual creative, the
            report says.
       From a bevy of M&A deals and consolidation on one end, to
       Facebookʼs Cambridge-Analytica scandal and GDPR on another, there
       were a lot of shake-ups in the advertising and media industries in
       2018.
       2019 will continue that trend, according to a new report by market
       research firm Forrester, which predicts not only more M&A action,
       but also trends like blockchain becoming more mainstream.
       "We feel that there are specific events and trends that will take
       place in 2019 – specifically around further M&A, blockchain
       introducing itself into advertising, creative supporting
       personalization and Facebook having to rely more heavily on
       Instagram and WhatsApp for growth," Collin Colburn, B2C marketing
       analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider.
       But on a macro level, the biggest battleground for media in 2019
       will be control for digital advertising dollars, he said. Amazon,
       AT&T, Verizon, and Disney have all made moves to counter the
       Facebook-Google duopoly, and will vie for their position with their
       technology stacks, distribution, and content capabilities.
       "Google and Facebook will start to feel this competition in 2019,
       and we will be watching to see if cracks begin forming in the
       foundation of the empires they have both built," Colburn said.
       Here are the five events that will reshape media ad advertising in
       2o19, according to Forrester:

AT&T will buy Roku to become a TV platform
       By snapping up Time Warner, AppNexus, and DirectTV, AT&T pieced
       together the content, technology, and distribution pipes needed to
       challenge the duopoly as well as rival TV networks. But to truly
       become a viable threat, it needs to become a bigger part of
       consumersʼ daily lives.
       AT&T will do that by acquiring Roku, Forrester predicts, as the
       acquisition will not only give it tremendous scale but also help it
       complement its new targeted advertising division, Xandr.
       "Buying Roku is a natural next step for AT&T after their
       acquisitions of Time Warner and AppNexus in 2018," Colburn said.

Instagram and WhatsApp will save Facebook
       From the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, to a cyber attack that
       impacted nearly 50 million user accounts, Facebook battled a spate
       of brand crises in 2018, severely impacting its brand reputation.
       The platform isnʼt growing at the pace it once was either, with
       monthly active users (MAUs) being flat in the second quarter of
       2018 in North America and falling in Europe, coupled with
       decelerated ad revenue growth.
       But the company canʼt be dismissed yet, according to Forrester,
       with Instagram quickly emerging as its shining star with more than
       1 billion monthly active users and a user growth rate outpacing
       Facebookʼs.
       "In 2019, we predict that Instagram will continue to pick up the
       slack while Facebook hones in on Messenger and WhatsApp to
       accelerate user and ad revenue growth for the parent company," the
       authors of the report write. "Messaging apps for one-on-one
       consumer interactions and advertising are still uncertain territory
       for brands but are increasing in interest — and Facebook will
       deliver."

Blockchain will become mainstream in advertising
       From ads that get clicked on by bots, to hidden fees and an
       overall lack of transparency, the digital ad ecosystem has been
       under fire of late on a number of fronts.
       A number of big brands and marketers are attempting to fight that
       by betting on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that
       underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
       By the end of 2019, advertisers will be able to follow every dollar
       that leaves their coffers, Forrester predicts, and be able to see
       exactly how much they are paying, and for what, at every step of
       the way.
       Big brands like Kelloggʼs, Kimberly-Clark, Pfizer, and Unilever are
       already leading the way by participating in a blockchain pilot
       program powered by IBM and Media Ocean that aims to bring complete
       transparency to media-buying.
       "Blockchain will make an important entrance in 2018, by exposing
       the value and costs of all the steps in the media supply chain,"
       Colburn said. "But it will be a couple of years before blockchain
       is ready to make the impact that marketers are really looking for –
       impression-level reporting that will expose advertising fraud."

Hyper-targeting will give way to hyper-focus on creative
       The rollout of GDPR sent many advertisers scrambling, casting a
       shadow on a future where they could hyper-target media, especially
       those brands lacking in first-party customer data.
       But as the use of consumer data comes under increasing scrutiny,
       the focus, at least for advertisers, will turn back to powerful
       creative, according to Forrester.
       In 2019, advertisers will start turning to creative adtech vendors
       like RevJet and Thunder to create contextually relevant ads cued by
       both first-party data, as well as data around the weather, time of
       day, and live events.
       Creative adtech will also improve ad quality and cross-channel
       storytelling. More brands will refrain from stalking consumers
       around the internet with cheap-looking, product-focused display
       ads, according to Forrester.
       "Despite what marketers and advertisers think, the media industry
       isnʼt nearly as customer-obsessed as it could be," Colburn said. "I
       am most bullish on advertisers trading in their hyper-targeting
       obsession for a hyper-focus on creative in advertising – it will
       improve both the customer experience and overall results."

A bidding war will break out for LiveRamp, and Google will take the cake
       Several players – from Adobe and Salesforce to ad holding companies
       – have had their eyes on LiveRamp since Axciomʼs data marketing
       services were acquired by IPG.
       The competition is only going to heat up more, with a huge bidding
       war breaking out for LiveRamp, according to Forrester.
       Forrester thinks the ultimate winner at the end though will be
       Google, which will outbid everyone with its trove of cash, making
       LiveRampʼs data available for customers using its newly branded and
       consolidated adtech stack, Google Marketing Platform.
       "With these acquisitions, the big keep getting bigger," Colburn
       said.

       Tim Cook
       Apple CEO Tim Cook AP One day, not too soon — but still sooner than
       you think — the smartphone will all but vanish, the way beepers and
       fax machines did before it.
       Make no mistake: Weʼre still probably at least a decade away from
       any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if
       weʼre all cyborgs by 2027, Iʼll happily eat my words. Assuming
       weʼre still eating at all, I guess.)
       Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the
       smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon,
       and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play.
       And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, thatʼs
       when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just
       in terms of individual products but in terms of how we actually
       live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself.
       Hereʼs a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march toward the death
       of the smartphone — and what the post-smartphone world is shaping
       up to look like.

The short term
       People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as
       revolutionary devices — small enough to carry everywhere, hefty
       enough to handle an increasingly large number of daily tasks, and
       packed full of the right mix of cameras and GPS sensors to make
       apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.
       But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop
       PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse,
       keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrank
       it, and made the input virtual and touch-based.
       So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week.
       Itʼs gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power
       under the hood. Itʼs impressive, but itʼs more refinement than
       revolution.
       Samsung Galaxy S8
       Samsung Galaxy S8. Business Insider
       Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual
       assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every
       single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with
       a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in
       conjunction with Facebookʼs Oculus.
       The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the
       Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented
       reality into the mainstream.
       And as devices like the Amazon Echo, the Sony PlayStation VR, and
       the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success,
       expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more
       gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in
       computing interfaces.

The medium term
       In the medium term, all of these various experimental and
       first-stage technologies will start to congeal into something
       familiar but bizarre.
       Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap are
       all working to build standalone augmented-reality headsets, which
       project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is
       rumored to be working on this.
       Microsoftʼs Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that
       augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV,
       and anything else with a screen. Thereʼs not much use for a
       separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment
       center if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into
       your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.
       apple airpods in ear
       At the same time, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Appleʼs own
       AirPods become more and more important in this world. As
       artificial-intelligence systems like Appleʼs Siri, Amazonʼs Alexa,
       Samsungʼs Bixby, and Microsoftʼs Cortana get smarter, there will be
       a rise not just in talking to computers but in having them talk
       back.
       In other words, computers will hijack your senses, more so than
       they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by
       technology. Itʼs a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches
       could mean in a world where it doesnʼt just control what you read
       on your phone but in what you see in the world around you.
       The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology
       blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this
       future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more
       balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing.
       You decide how you feel about that.

The really crazy future
       Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely
       on gadgetry that you have to wear, even if itʼs only a pair of
       glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most
       unpredictable advancements go even further — provided youʼre
       willing to wait a few extra decades, that is.
       This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company
       cofounded by Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains
       by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on
       your brain and bridges it to a computer. Itʼs the next step beyond
       even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as human and
       machine become one.
       Assuming the science works — and lots of smart people believe that
       it will — this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones
       started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and
       augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need
       it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap.
       Ray Kurzweil
       Futurist Ray Kurzweil has been predicting our cyborg futures for a
       long time now. Tech Insider
       Musk has said this is because the rise of artificial intelligence —
       which underpins a lot of the other technologies, including voice
       assistants and virtual reality — means humans will have to augment
       themselves just to keep up with the machines. If youʼre really
       curious about this idea, futurist Ray Kurzweil is the leading voice
       on the topic.
       The idea of human/machine fusion is a terrifying one, with
       science-fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike
       having very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first
       place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really
       knows what this world would look like in practice.
       So if and when the smartphone dies, itʼll actually be the end of an
       era in more ways than one. Itʼll be the end of machines that we
       carry with us passively and the beginning of something that bridges
       our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital information.
       Itʼs going to get weird.
       And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give us
       superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities beyond
       anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the human mind
       would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe Iʼm just an
       optimist.

       Donʼt be surprised when you eventually see a new rocketship tab in
       your Facebook app.
       The tab is essentially a second News Feed, except without any posts
       or baby pictures from your friends. Instead, Facebook is using the
       tab to only show recommended videos and articles based on what you
       already like and watch in your main News Feed.
       Facebook has been quietly testing the new tab in different parts of
       the world for the past several weeks, a company spokesperson told
       Business Insider.
       “We are testing a complementary feed of popular articles, videos,
       and photos, customized for each person based on content that might
       be interesting to them," the spokesperson said. "Weʼve heard from
       people that they want an easy way to explore new content they
       havenʼt connected with yet.”
       Facebook frequently tests changes to its apps that are never rolled
       out to all of its 1.8 billion users. But now that more people,
       including those in the US, are starting to see the rocketship tab,
       Facebook appears close to making the feature available to everyone.

     —Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) April 2, 2017
       Creating a second News Feed could help Facebook overcome a looming
       threat to its ad business. The company has warned that itʼs nearing
       the limit of ads it can stuff into the News Feed, and this new tab
       could let it show more ads in videos and between stories.

          + Facebook has banned a network of fake accounts that were
            trying to influence politics in Moldova.
          + The social network says the campaign had links to the Moldovan
            government.
          + Itʼs the latest example of groups using Facebook to
            nefariously meddle in domestic affairs in countries around the
            world.
       Another day, another covert campaign on Facebook to influence
       politics using fake accounts.
       The Silicon Valley social network announced on Thursday that it had
       discovered a network of hundreds and accounts and pages in
       targeting people in Moldova, in an apparent attempt to influence
       political debate and social issues in the country ahead of upcoming
       elections — and Facebook says that employees of the Moldovan
       government were involved.
       In a blog post, Facebookʼs head of cybersecurity police Nathaniel
       Gleicher said the company has "removed 168 Facebook accounts, 28
       Pages and eight Instagram accounts for engaging in coordinated
       inauthentic behavior targeting people in Moldova. This activity
       originated in Moldova, and used a combination of fake accounts and
       some authentic accounts to mislead others about who they were and
       what they were doing."
       The takedowns are the latest example of how malicious actors have
       weaponized Facebook, time and time again, to sow division and push
       political narratives. Itʼs a tactic that first drew scrutiny after
       Russia spread inflammatory disinformation and propaganda on
       Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election.
       And it indicates that Facebook, despite significant investments in
       "safety and security," has yet to eradicate these nefarious
       activities outright, and that some governments are now seemingly
       using them against their own citizens.
       In January 2019, Facebook announced it had detected a similar
       campaign being run from Iran, targeting people in numerous
       countries, from Afghanistan to France, Germany, India, Israel, the
       US, and South Africa. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously described
       the battle between Facebook and hostile actors as an "arms race,"
       with both sides fighting to stay ahead.
       Gleicher said that employees of the Moldovan government were behind
       at least some of the activity:
       "The Page admins and account owners typically posted about local
       news and political issues such as required Russian or English
       language education and reunification with Romania. They also shared
       manipulated photos, divisive narratives and satire and impersonated
       a local fact checking organization’s Page that called out other
       Pages for spreading fake news. Although the people behind this
       activity attempted to conceal their identities, our manual review
       found that some of this activity was linked to employees of the
       Moldovan government."

          + The advertising and media industries will continue to see
            seismic changes in 2019, according to a new report by market
            research firm Forrester.
          + AT&T will buy Roku and Google will acquire LiveRamp in 2019,
            Forrester predicts.
          + Additionally, blockchain will become increasingly mainstream,
            and hyper-targeting will give way to contextual creative, the
            report says.
       From a bevy of M&A deals and consolidation on one end, to
       Facebookʼs Cambridge-Analytica scandal and GDPR on another, there
       were a lot of shake-ups in the advertising and media industries in
       2018.
       2019 will continue that trend, according to a new report by market
       research firm Forrester, which predicts not only more M&A action,
       but also trends like blockchain becoming more mainstream.
       "We feel that there are specific events and trends that will take
       place in 2019 – specifically around further M&A, blockchain
       introducing itself into advertising, creative supporting
       personalization and Facebook having to rely more heavily on
       Instagram and WhatsApp for growth," Collin Colburn, B2C marketing
       analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider.
       But on a macro level, the biggest battleground for media in 2019
       will be control for digital advertising dollars, he said. Amazon,
       AT&T, Verizon, and Disney have all made moves to counter the
       Facebook-Google duopoly, and will vie for their position with their
       technology stacks, distribution, and content capabilities.
       "Google and Facebook will start to feel this competition in 2019,
       and we will be watching to see if cracks begin forming in the
       foundation of the empires they have both built," Colburn said.
       Here are the five events that will reshape media ad advertising in
       2o19, according to Forrester:

AT&T will buy Roku to become a TV platform
       By snapping up Time Warner, AppNexus, and DirectTV, AT&T pieced
       together the content, technology, and distribution pipes needed to
       challenge the duopoly as well as rival TV networks. But to truly
       become a viable threat, it needs to become a bigger part of
       consumersʼ daily lives.
       AT&T will do that by acquiring Roku, Forrester predicts, as the
       acquisition will not only give it tremendous scale but also help it
       complement its new targeted advertising division, Xandr.
       "Buying Roku is a natural next step for AT&T after their
       acquisitions of Time Warner and AppNexus in 2018," Colburn said.

Instagram and WhatsApp will save Facebook
       From the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, to a cyber attack that
       impacted nearly 50 million user accounts, Facebook battled a spate
       of brand crises in 2018, severely impacting its brand reputation.
       The platform isnʼt growing at the pace it once was either, with
       monthly active users (MAUs) being flat in the second quarter of
       2018 in North America and falling in Europe, coupled with
       decelerated ad revenue growth.
       But the company canʼt be dismissed yet, according to Forrester,
       with Instagram quickly emerging as its shining star with more than
       1 billion monthly active users and a user growth rate outpacing
       Facebookʼs.
       "In 2019, we predict that Instagram will continue to pick up the
       slack while Facebook hones in on Messenger and WhatsApp to
       accelerate user and ad revenue growth for the parent company," the
       authors of the report write. "Messaging apps for one-on-one
       consumer interactions and advertising are still uncertain territory
       for brands but are increasing in interest — and Facebook will
       deliver."

Blockchain will become mainstream in advertising
       From ads that get clicked on by bots, to hidden fees and an
       overall lack of transparency, the digital ad ecosystem has been
       under fire of late on a number of fronts.
       A number of big brands and marketers are attempting to fight that
       by betting on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that
       underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
       By the end of 2019, advertisers will be able to follow every dollar
       that leaves their coffers, Forrester predicts, and be able to see
       exactly how much they are paying, and for what, at every step of
       the way.
       Big brands like Kelloggʼs, Kimberly-Clark, Pfizer, and Unilever are
       already leading the way by participating in a blockchain pilot
       program powered by IBM and Media Ocean that aims to bring complete
       transparency to media-buying.
       "Blockchain will make an important entrance in 2018, by exposing
       the value and costs of all the steps in the media supply chain,"
       Colburn said. "But it will be a couple of years before blockchain
       is ready to make the impact that marketers are really looking for –
       impression-level reporting that will expose advertising fraud."

Hyper-targeting will give way to hyper-focus on creative
       The rollout of GDPR sent many advertisers scrambling, casting a
       shadow on a future where they could hyper-target media, especially
       those brands lacking in first-party customer data.
       But as the use of consumer data comes under increasing scrutiny,
       the focus, at least for advertisers, will turn back to powerful
       creative, according to Forrester.
       In 2019, advertisers will start turning to creative adtech vendors
       like RevJet and Thunder to create contextually relevant ads cued by
       both first-party data, as well as data around the weather, time of
       day, and live events.
       Creative adtech will also improve ad quality and cross-channel
       storytelling. More brands will refrain from stalking consumers
       around the internet with cheap-looking, product-focused display
       ads, according to Forrester.
       "Despite what marketers and advertisers think, the media industry
       isnʼt nearly as customer-obsessed as it could be," Colburn said. "I
       am most bullish on advertisers trading in their hyper-targeting
       obsession for a hyper-focus on creative in advertising – it will
       improve both the customer experience and overall results."

A bidding war will break out for LiveRamp, and Google will take the cake
       Several players – from Adobe and Salesforce to ad holding companies
       – have had their eyes on LiveRamp since Axciomʼs data marketing
       services were acquired by IPG.
       The competition is only going to heat up more, with a huge bidding
       war breaking out for LiveRamp, according to Forrester.
       Forrester thinks the ultimate winner at the end though will be
       Google, which will outbid everyone with its trove of cash, making
       LiveRampʼs data available for customers using its newly branded and
       consolidated adtech stack, Google Marketing Platform.
       "With these acquisitions, the big keep getting bigger," Colburn
       said.

       Tim Cook
       Apple CEO Tim Cook AP One day, not too soon — but still sooner than
       you think — the smartphone will all but vanish, the way beepers and
       fax machines did before it.
       Make no mistake: Weʼre still probably at least a decade away from
       any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if
       weʼre all cyborgs by 2027, Iʼll happily eat my words. Assuming
       weʼre still eating at all, I guess.)
       Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the
       smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon,
       and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play.
       And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, thatʼs
       when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just
       in terms of individual products but in terms of how we actually
       live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself.
       Hereʼs a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march toward the death
       of the smartphone — and what the post-smartphone world is shaping
       up to look like.

The short term
       People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as
       revolutionary devices — small enough to carry everywhere, hefty
       enough to handle an increasingly large number of daily tasks, and
       packed full of the right mix of cameras and GPS sensors to make
       apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.
       But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop
       PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse,
       keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrank
       it, and made the input virtual and touch-based.
       So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week.
       Itʼs gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power
       under the hood. Itʼs impressive, but itʼs more refinement than
       revolution.
       Samsung Galaxy S8
       Samsung Galaxy S8. Business Insider
       Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual
       assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every
       single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with
       a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in
       conjunction with Facebookʼs Oculus.
       The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the
       Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented
       reality into the mainstream.
       And as devices like the Amazon Echo, the Sony PlayStation VR, and
       the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success,
       expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more
       gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in
       computing interfaces.

The medium term
       In the medium term, all of these various experimental and
       first-stage technologies will start to congeal into something
       familiar but bizarre.
       Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap are
       all working to build standalone augmented-reality headsets, which
       project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is
       rumored to be working on this.
       Microsoftʼs Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that
       augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV,
       and anything else with a screen. Thereʼs not much use for a
       separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment
       center if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into
       your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.
       apple airpods in ear
       At the same time, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Appleʼs own
       AirPods become more and more important in this world. As
       artificial-intelligence systems like Appleʼs Siri, Amazonʼs Alexa,
       Samsungʼs Bixby, and Microsoftʼs Cortana get smarter, there will be
       a rise not just in talking to computers but in having them talk
       back.
       In other words, computers will hijack your senses, more so than
       they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by
       technology. Itʼs a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches
       could mean in a world where it doesnʼt just control what you read
       on your phone but in what you see in the world around you.
       The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology
       blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this
       future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more
       balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing.
       You decide how you feel about that.

The really crazy future
       Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely
       on gadgetry that you have to wear, even if itʼs only a pair of
       glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most
       unpredictable advancements go even further — provided youʼre
       willing to wait a few extra decades, that is.
       This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company
       cofounded by Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains
       by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on
       your brain and bridges it to a computer. Itʼs the next step beyond
       even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as human and
       machine become one.
       Assuming the science works — and lots of smart people believe that
       it will — this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones
       started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and
       augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need
       it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap.
       Ray Kurzweil
       Futurist Ray Kurzweil has been predicting our cyborg futures for a
       long time now. Tech Insider
       Musk has said this is because the rise of artificial intelligence —
       which underpins a lot of the other technologies, including voice
       assistants and virtual reality — means humans will have to augment
       themselves just to keep up with the machines. If youʼre really
       curious about this idea, futurist Ray Kurzweil is the leading voice
       on the topic.
       The idea of human/machine fusion is a terrifying one, with
       science-fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike
       having very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first
       place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really
       knows what this world would look like in practice.
       So if and when the smartphone dies, itʼll actually be the end of an
       era in more ways than one. Itʼll be the end of machines that we
       carry with us passively and the beginning of something that bridges
       our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital information.
       Itʼs going to get weird.
       And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give us
       superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities beyond
       anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the human mind
       would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe Iʼm just an
       optimist.

       Donʼt be surprised when you eventually see a new rocketship tab in
       your Facebook app.
       The tab is essentially a second News Feed, except without any posts
       or baby pictures from your friends. Instead, Facebook is using the
       tab to only show recommended videos and articles based on what you
       already like and watch in your main News Feed.
       Facebook has been quietly testing the new tab in different parts of
       the world for the past several weeks, a company spokesperson told
       Business Insider.
       “We are testing a complementary feed of popular articles, videos,
       and photos, customized for each person based on content that might
       be interesting to them," the spokesperson said. "Weʼve heard from
       people that they want an easy way to explore new content they
       havenʼt connected with yet.”
       Facebook frequently tests changes to its apps that are never rolled
       out to all of its 1.8 billion users. But now that more people,
       including those in the US, are starting to see the rocketship tab,
       Facebook appears close to making the feature available to everyone.

     —Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) April 2, 2017
       Creating a second News Feed could help Facebook overcome a looming
       threat to its ad business. The company has warned that itʼs nearing
       the limit of ads it can stuff into the News Feed, and this new tab
       could let it show more ads in videos and between stories.
