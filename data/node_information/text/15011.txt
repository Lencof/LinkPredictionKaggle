       The quicker we can engage with a prospect, the better our odds are
       of converting them to a customer. Live chat is a great way to get

       After we installed Olark, our visitor-to-trial conversion rate
       doubled — and the ability to capture and share chat transcripts
       created a much tighter feedback loop between our sales, support,
       and marketing teams.
