   The people were lovely and working there was fine it was easily managed
   around school and college . Hours were 8 hr shifts , minimum wage was
   the only thing I’d change if I stayed there for longer , a little bit
   more for the job would be better . Overall they are good to work for.

   Dublin on 15 July 2019
   Retention of staff is very low, staff moral is non-existent, almost
   none of the staff ever seem to want to be there. Customers are
   generally very nice but some feel entitled to be rude.

   Restaurant / Business manager (Current Employee) –  Limerick – 17
   August 2019
   McDonald's gives you opportunity to both work and study at same time,
   never issues requesting time off in advance. They fit my schedule
   around my availability. Very busy times but well managed and staffed to
   deal with these.

   It's a job
   Crew Member (Current Employee) –  Tralee, County Kerry – 10 August 2019
   Basically nobody who works there, actually enjoys working there. But
   it's a job, so...
   Tralee is extremely busy, so you basically never get to chill, you're
   working 99% of your hours there.
   The pay is the minimum they can afford to pay and they increase it by
   10-30 cents/hour if your performance is very high after reviews. But -
   dont really count on it.
   If you're good at your job, you get the hours, but that's shift work -
   sometimes you end at 2 and at 11 or 12 you're scheduled to start your
   next shift.
   Been there for almost 2 years, because not too many other options. And
   you get used to it.
   Half of the other crew is good people. Lots of young people.

   The people were fantastic but the job wasn't.
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Maynooth, County Kildare – 3 July 2019
   As stated, the people I worked with were great but the job itself was
   immensely stressful.
   I'm grateful for organisational and time-management skills that I
   learned, but the imbalance of work/life was too much.
   Pros
   Atmosphere, team work, lunches
   Cons
   One-week notice on schedules.

   Stressful and a starter job.
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Shop street, Galway – 23 June 2019
   When you Clock in, you get told where to go by the shift manager. Very
   busy job, constantly going which makes time fly. Tills are the best
   area to be as you get to interact with the customers, some good and
   some bad. Some managers are useless and cause all the staff in to be
   stressed out. The owner is nice guy, can be stressed out at times but
   is usually nice. Every night someone has to clean the toilets, not a
   pretty sight. You get free lunches.
   Pros
   Free lunches.
   Cons
   Bad managers and rude customers.

   Very bad atmosphere
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Ennis, County Clare – 23 June 2019
   Management think it's ok to shout at you and are very demeaning in
   front of crew and customers. you do not get thanked for hard work put
   in, they only focus on the negatives. Training is not given properly,
   your trained for a few days then abandoned then expected to be perfect.
   There is no fun atmosphere as McDonald's promote in fact your frowned
   upon for having a personality. Not very flexible in working hours,
   again as promoted in McDonald's recruitment ads. shifts are all over
   the place and they say it's ok to change your shift up to 24hrs before.
   How is anyone supposed to organise a life round work. you would be hard
   pushed to progress any further than crew because of lack of training
   and culture of friends and family have seniority in any advancement.
   Rules change to suit management, no notification given to staff on
   changes then you get punished for breaking rules you are not aware of
   or have changed. Overall this store is not a fun place to work, some of
   the staff are friendly enough.
   Pros
   Wages paid fortnightly on time.
   Cons
   Long hours, unfriendly atmosphere, bullying by management

   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Ennis, County Clare – 15 June 2019
   Despite what is said in the welcome meeting you will never get your
   rota two weeks in advance ever. Pay is frequently wrong. Extremely
   unprofessional management. Some lovely staff however the culture of
   bullying is disheartening. It's hard to be secure in a job with three
   month contracts.
   Pros
   Double pay on bank holidays

   Hostile staff and management

   Perfect Job for a Hard Worker
   Crew Member (Current Employee) –  Dublin – 13 June 2019
   Would highly recommend to anyone. The work is hard as it is often very
   busy so can be very stressful at times but you get used to it after a
   while. Work is sometimes boring,tiring, disgusting but the great
   coworkers make it worthwhile. Great atmosphere between staff and
   management most of the time. Extremely flexible and accommodating
   providing you give them warning in advance, great if you're in school
   or college. Lots of opportunity to progress if you put in hard work.
   Pros
   Free lunches, flexible, never boring, opportunity to advance, great
   coworkers
   Cons
   Low pay, very busy, rude customers

   Enjoyable place to work in.
   First Assistant ( part of my TY programme) (Former Employee) –  Cashel,
   County Tipperary – 30 May 2019
   Typical day - work-break-work ( 30-45 minutes for lunch, food is on
   discount).
   I learned how to organize myself, and work as part of the team.
   Management was clear on her tasks and was very friendly.
   People who I was working with were all young, Irish nationals, very
   friendly open minded and helpful.
   The hardest part of the job was to work on Sunday when there was more
   customers than usually.
   The most enjoyable part of the job is when I was working on burger's
   side of the kitchen.
   Pros
   Discounted lunches.
   Cons
   Non.

   Fun workplace with amazing people
   Shift Manager (Former Employee) –  Dublin – 29 May 2019
   Typical day at work would include assigning crew members to positions
   you would feel would maximize productivity to run a smooth shift.
   I would also run the day to day business of my store and assist staff
   when we would have high volumes of customers.
   The hardest part of the job would be dealing with high volumes of
   customers which would put pressure on running your shift smoothly.
   The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people in my team who I
   got on greatly with.
   Pros
   Free lunches, great team, advancement opportunities
   Cons
   Long hours and personally, travelling

   The people were lovely and working there was fine it was easily managed
   around school and college . Hours were 8 hr shifts , minimum wage was
   the only thing I’d change if I stayed there for longer , a little bit
   more for the job would be better . Overall they are good to work for.

   No Feeling of Community or Investment in Work
   Written by Crew Member (Current Employee) from Dublin Airport, County
   Dublin on 15 July 2019
   Retention of staff is very low, staff moral is non-existent, almost
   none of the staff ever seem to want to be there. Customers are
   generally very nice but some feel entitled to be rude.

   Restaurant / Business manager (Current Employee) –  Limerick – 17

   McDonald's gives you opportunity to both work and study at same time,
   never issues requesting time off in advance. They fit my schedule
   around my availability. Very busy times but well managed and staffed to
   deal with these.

   Basically nobody who works there, actually enjoys working there. But
   it's a job, so...
   Tralee is extremely busy, so you basically never get to chill, you're
   working 99% of your hours there.
   The pay is the minimum they can afford to pay and they increase it by
   10-30 cents/hour if your performance is very high after reviews. But -
   dont really count on it.
   If you're good at your job, you get the hours, but that's shift work -
   sometimes you end at 2 and at 11 or 12 you're scheduled to start your
   next shift.
   Been there for almost 2 years, because not too many other options. And
   you get used to it.
   Half of the other crew is good people. Lots of young people.

   No Feeling of Community or Investment in Work
   Crew Member (Current Employee) –  Dublin Airport, County Dublin – 15
   July 2019
   Retention of staff is very low, staff moral is non-existent, almost
   none of the staff ever seem to want to be there. Customers are
   generally very nice but some feel entitled to be rude.

   The people were fantastic but the job wasn't.
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Maynooth, County Kildare – 3 July 2019
   As stated, the people I worked with were great but the job itself was
   immensely stressful.
   I'm grateful for organisational and time-management skills that I
   learned, but the imbalance of work/life was too much.
   Pros
   Atmosphere, team work, lunches
   Cons
   One-week notice on schedules.

   Stressful and a starter job.
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Shop street, Galway – 23 June 2019
   When you Clock in, you get told where to go by the shift manager. Very
   busy job, constantly going which makes time fly. Tills are the best
   area to be as you get to interact with the customers, some good and
   some bad. Some managers are useless and cause all the staff in to be
   stressed out. The owner is nice guy, can be stressed out at times but
   is usually nice. Every night someone has to clean the toilets, not a
   pretty sight. You get free lunches.
   Pros
   Free lunches.
   Cons
   Bad managers and rude customers.

   Very bad atmosphere
   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Ennis, County Clare – 23 June 2019
   Management think it's ok to shout at you and are very demeaning in
   front of crew and customers. you do not get thanked for hard work put
   in, they only focus on the negatives. Training is not given properly,
   your trained for a few days then abandoned then expected to be perfect.
   There is no fun atmosphere as McDonald's promote in fact your frowned
   upon for having a personality. Not very flexible in working hours,
   again as promoted in McDonald's recruitment ads. shifts are all over
   the place and they say it's ok to change your shift up to 24hrs before.
   How is anyone supposed to organise a life round work. you would be hard
   pushed to progress any further than crew because of lack of training
   and culture of friends and family have seniority in any advancement.
   Rules change to suit management, no notification given to staff on
   changes then you get punished for breaking rules you are not aware of
   or have changed. Overall this store is not a fun place to work, some of
   the staff are friendly enough.
   Pros
   Wages paid fortnightly on time.
   Cons
   Long hours, unfriendly atmosphere, bullying by management

   Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Ennis, County Clare – 15 June 2019
   Despite what is said in the welcome meeting you will never get your
   rota two weeks in advance ever. Pay is frequently wrong. Extremely
   unprofessional management. Some lovely staff however the culture of
   bullying is disheartening. It's hard to be secure in a job with three
   month contracts.
   Pros
   Double pay on bank holidays
   Cons
   Hostile staff and management

   Perfect Job for a Hard Worker
   Crew Member (Current Employee) –  Dublin – 13 June 2019
   Would highly recommend to anyone. The work is hard as it is often very
   busy so can be very stressful at times but you get used to it after a
   while. Work is sometimes boring,tiring, disgusting but the great
   coworkers make it worthwhile. Great atmosphere between staff and
   management most of the time. Extremely flexible and accommodating
   providing you give them warning in advance, great if you're in school
   or college. Lots of opportunity to progress if you put in hard work.
   Pros
   Free lunches, flexible, never boring, opportunity to advance, great
   coworkers
   Cons
   Low pay, very busy, rude customers

   Fast paced, good people to work with and work for, It's still a minimum
   wage job with not a lot of benefits, it also pays every fortnight which
   i didnt like but you were constantly moving around stations so you
   don't get bored
   Pros

   Enjoyable place to work in.
   First Assistant ( part of my TY programme) (Former Employee) –  Cashel,
   County Tipperary – 30 May 2019
   Typical day - work-break-work ( 30-45 minutes for lunch, food is on
   discount).
   I learned how to organize myself, and work as part of the team.
   Management was clear on her tasks and was very friendly.
   People who I was working with were all young, Irish nationals, very
   friendly open minded and helpful.
   The hardest part of the job was to work on Sunday when there was more
   customers than usually.
   The most enjoyable part of the job is when I was working on burger's
   side of the kitchen.
   Pros
   Discounted lunches.
   Cons
   Non.

   Fun workplace with amazing people
   Shift Manager (Former Employee) –  Dublin – 29 May 2019
   Typical day at work would include assigning crew members to positions
   you would feel would maximize productivity to run a smooth shift.
   I would also run the day to day business of my store and assist staff
   when we would have high volumes of customers.
   The hardest part of the job would be dealing with high volumes of
   customers which would put pressure on running your shift smoothly.
   The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people in my team who I
   got on greatly with.
   Pros
   Free lunches, great team, advancement opportunities
   Cons
   Long hours and personally, travelling
