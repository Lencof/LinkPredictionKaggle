   Illustration for article titled Report: Spider-Man Will No Longer Be
   Shared by Marvel and Sony [Updated]

   Huge news in the world of superheroes. Deadline reports that Disney and
   Sony have come to a stalemate in regards to Spider-Man and that Marvel
   Studios, along with its president Kevin Feige, will no longer be
   producing Spider-Man films.

   This comes after Spider-Man: Far From Home, which is being re-released
   in a few weeks, became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time.

   When contacted by io9, a Sony representative said it’s their belief
   this dispute is simply over a producer credit and negotiations are
   ongoing. They further clarified that Feige has contributed to other
   Spider-centric movies that he did not receive a producer credit on.
   Other sources tell us the Deadline story is completely accurate.
   [Update 8/21/2019: Sony has now released an official statement which
   you can read here.]

   The issue, as you’d expect, is money. While Disney was happy to take
   only a small percentage of grosses on Spider-Man: Homecoming and
   Spider-Man: Far From Home (in exchange for Sony allowing Marvel to use
   the character in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War,
   and Avengers: Endgame), a debate among executives began to take place
   about the future. According to Deadline, Disney wanted to split profits
   50/50 but Sony didn’t even counter that.

   Two more Spider-Man films are reportedly in development, with both
   director Jon Watts and star Tom Holland attached. Plus, Sony has begun
   its own Spider-Man mini-universe thanks to huge hits like Venom and
   Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, both of which have sequels on the
   way. Rumor has it, Disney and Marvel were even hoping to help out with
   those films to further expand the crossover—but in the end, the studios
   simply asked for more than Sony was willing to give. Apparently, Sony
   feels it already has the big pieces in place, so the films will be fine
   without Feige. We’ll see how that goes.

   Definitely head over to the Deadline piece to read more of the details
   but this is certainly a disappointing day for fans of the Marvel
   Cinematic Universe. Potentially removing Spider-Man leaves that tiny
   asterisk on a world that had just inherited the X-Men and Fantastic
   Four thanks to the Fox deal. For a brief moment, all of Marvel’s heroes
   were home. But now, it seems like Sony will make its Spider-Man movies
   on its own.

   The U.S. military has warned service members about the potential for a
   mass shooter at screenings of the Warner Bros. film Joker, which has
   sparked wide concerns from, among others, the families of those killed
   during the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado.

   The U.S. Army confirmed on Tuesday that the warning was widely
   distributed after social media posts related to extremists classified
   as “incels,” were uncovered by intelligence officials at the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation.

   In a September 18th email, service members were instructed to remain
   aware of their surroundings and “identify two escape routes” when
   entering theaters. In the event of a shooting, they were instructed to
   “run, hide, fight.”

   “Run if you can,” the safety notice said. “If you’re stuck, hide (also
   known as ‘sheltering in place’), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds
   you, fight with whatever you can.”

Subject Matter

   The Army said it became aware of potential threats after receiving a
   bulletin from the FBI, but that it was unaware of any specific plots or
   suspects. The notice, which was marked “For Official Use Only,” was
   relayed purely as a precautionary measure, it said.

   Advertisement

   A separate memo, issued on Monday by senior officials in the U.S.
   Army’s criminal investigation division, stated that the Army had
   obtained “credible” intelligence from Texas law enforcement officials
   pertaining to “disturbing and very specific chatter” on the dark web
   “regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the
   release.”

   “We do this routinely because the safety and security of our workforce
   is paramount,” an Army spokesperson said of the widely distributed
   warning. “We want our workforce to be prepared and diligent on personal
   safety both inside the workplace and out.”

   Incel is a term that was adopted in the ‘90s by an online subgroup of
   self-professed “involuntary celibate” men. Over time, some radicalized
   members of the incel community have formed an ideology that promotes
   violence. Elliot Rodger self-identified as an incel before he killed
   six people near the campus of the University of California, Santa
   Barbara in 2014. And James Holmes, the man who opened fire in a crowded
   movie theater in 2012 has become a bit of a hero to the incel
   community. It’s often been repeated that Holmes was inspired by the
   Joker, a claim that primarily rests on statements the killer reportedly
   made to police after the fact in which he said he “was the Joker.”
   Speaking with the Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Oates, Aurora’s chief of
   police at the time, said that “there is no evidence” the shooter ever
   said that.

   In the alert emailed to service members, Army officials claimed that
   incels “also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the
   Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to be
   happy, but eventually fights back against bullies.”

   “While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence
   products, the FBI is in touch with our law enforcement and private
   sector partners about the online posts,” an FBI spokesperson said. “As
   always, we encourage the public to remain vigilant and to promptly
   report suspicious activity to law enforcement.”

   In an age of frequent mass shootings by predominately white American
   men—at least some of whom have referenced in writing their frustrations
   with sex—the film has sparked controversy over its desire to compel its
   audience (at least in its first half) to empathize with a mentally
   unbalanced and unloved “loser” who inevitably resorts to mass murder.

   The gritty film, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, reportedly
   makes strides to depict its titular character in a far more realistic
   fashion than his comics counterpart. Rather than being transformed into
   the “Joker” after falling into a vat of acid—as the villain so often
   does in depictions of his DC Comics origin—a harsh life compounded by
   constant mockery and an inability to “get the girl” is what ultimately
   leads to his rise as the infamously batty executioner of comic book
   lore.

   The Hollywood Reporter reported Tuesday that families who lost
   relatives in the Aurora shooting, which claimed the lives of 12
   moviegoers in 2012 during a screening of the Batman film The Dark
   Knight Rises, signed a letter this week to Warner Bros. sharing
   concerns about the Joker film. With the film set to open on October
   4th, the families asked the legendary film studio to donate to groups
   that aid victims of gun violence.

   “We are calling on you to be a part of the growing chorus of corporate
   leaders who understand that they have a social responsibility to keep
   us all safe,” the letter reportedly says. The film will not be shown in
   the Colorado theater where the shooting occurred.

   An Air Force officer at Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia—granted
   anonymity to discuss the Defense Department’s warning freely—said that
   such notices are occasionally circulated by security managers, but only
   when deemed “credible.” The officer said that in some cases, commanders
   may issue an advisory in response; however, one was not issued in this
   case.

   “Frankly, beyond the email, I’ve heard little about it,” the officer
   said. “A few folks said they’d avoid opening night, or passed it on to
   their family members for consideration, but I haven’t heard much else
   in conversation beyond that.”

   Advertisement

   Warner Bros. did not respond to a request for comment.

   In a statement broadly addressing the controversy over the film, Warner
   Bros. called gun violence a “critical issue” and said that in recent
   weeks it has called on policymakers to enact legislation to address
   what it called an “epidemic” of violence. Regardless, the purpose of
   storytelling, it said, was to “provoke difficult conversations around
   complex issues.” The company went on to make clear that the film does
   not endorse real-world violence and said that “it is not the intention
   of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as
   a hero.”

   You can read the email that was circulated by the military in full
   below:

     Team,

     Posts on social media have made reference to involuntary celibate
     (“incel”) extremists replicating the 2012 theater shooting in
     Aurora, Colorado, at screenings of the Joker movie at nationwide
     theaters. This presents a potential risk to DOD personnel and family
     members, though there are no known specific credible threats to the
     opening of the Joker on 4 October.

     Incels are individuals who express frustration from perceived
     disadvantages to starting intimate relationships. Incel extremists
     idolize violent individuals like the Aurora movie theater shooter.
     They also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the
     Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to
     be happy, but eventually fights back against his bullies.

     When entering theaters, identify two escape routes, remain aware of
     your surroundings, and remember the phrase “run, hide, fight.” Run
     if you can. If you’re stuck, hide (also referred to as “sheltering
     in place”), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds you, fight with
     whatever you can.

Ta-Nehisi Coates’ New Novel Crafts a Fresh Mythology from Slavery, Sci-Fi,

   Last week, Ta-Nehisi Coates was in his kitchen, peeling and cutting
   carrots that his wife had brought from the farmer’s market. This week,
   he’s putting The Water Dancer—the novel that marks his literary fiction
   debut—out into the world. One of those things makes him very nervous.

   [Disclosure: I’ve known Ta-Nehisi for years and he was a consultant on
   the Rise of The Black Panther miniseries that I wrote for Marvel.]

   Chances are, if you know Coates’ name, it’s because of his non-fiction
   writing. Over the past 10 years, his books and articles like “The Case
   for Reparations,” “The First White President,” and Between The World
   And Me have explored how slavery and institutionalized racism have left
   behind legacies that America still needs to reckon with. While doing
   the writing that would win him awards, Coates would also blog about his
   love of superhero comics and his first published foray into fiction was
   writing Black Panther for Marvel.

   But, for 10 years, another unwieldy ambition was also cascading through
   his head: a novel that would try and fuse elements of all his passions
   into an altogether new whole. The Water Dancer is out this week from
   Penguin Random House and represents the end of a decade-long journey
   for Coates.

   The main character of The Water Dancer is Hiram “Hi” Walker, son of a
   slave-holding white man and the woman who was his property. As a young
   man, Hi begins to manifest a photographic memory and the gift of
   Conduction, a supernatural ability that might carry him and others to
   freedom if he learns to master it. But others in 19th Century Virginia
   know about Conduction, too, and Hi’s life falls into great complication
   and danger when he crosses paths with those who want to use him for
   their own ends.

   As we spoke on the phone last week, Coates was banging around in the
   kitchen while holding forth about the self-doubt, research, and
   rewriting that went into shaping The Water Dancer. The interview that
   follows is an edited, condensed version of our conversation.

   Advertisement
     __________________________________________________________________

   io9: One of the things that strikes me about how you construct the
   suspense in the book is that it feels pulpy. The motivations are
   predicated on deep impulses and yearning. And Hi feels hot-headed at
   times, but you’ve also told me it was really important to minimize
   violence as a liberating tool. Why did this book have to be told in
   this specific way?

   Advertisement

   Ta-Nehisi Coates: Yeah, that’s actually a great question. Especially
   what you said about the pulpy part, because arguably, violence is
   always really important with pulpy fiction, the kind of storytelling
   you and I came up on. I felt two things. One: I am who I am. In terms
   of my influences. And my influences are quite well recorded. I played
   Dungeons & Dragons, I read comic books. I listened to hip-hop. Those
   are very Low Culture, you know what I mean? In terms of my fiction,
   those are the sort of things that stay with me. So, that was one thing.
   But there’s another conflicting thing that took some years to get to.
   One of the fascinating things about African American history is how it
   sits with the typical Western narrative of the hero. Often, the hero
   starts his rise and ends with killing his antagonist in a violent
   confrontation. And, a lot of times, that’s how heroes are built. And as
   a younger reader, I hungered for that from black folk.

   I always wondered why there weren’t black people who did that. But, as
   I read and researched, I actually realized a beautiful thing about
   black history in America: that very often, we have not had the recourse
   to violence and we had to triumph in other ways. Sorry, I’m opening
   this Isabel Wilkerson book [The Warmth of Other Suns] because she has
   this great quote that I think about all the time. She’s talking about
   resistance and black people and the Great Migration:

     “What binds these stories together was the back-against-the-wall,
     reluctant yet hopeful search for something better, any place but
     where they were. They did what human beings looking for freedom,
     throughout history, have often done. They left.”

   Advertisement

   And that was one of the first times I heard someone actively position
   the act of leaving, of running, as resistance. And that’s a theme all
   throughout history because we were enslaved, right? And so, on one
   level I was like, “Oh, I can tell a different kind of story”—not a
   story about how he comes back and kills his master and claims his
   woman, you know what I mean? One where violence is not really possible,
   so now your hero has to resort to other means. And that, to me, was a
   thrilling way to tell a story.

   Because you can feel certain things, but never really act on them. And
   there’s a gender component to that, too. Because in many ways I wanted
   to write a Western. I love Westerns. An adventure story, you know? But
   one of the tropes of Westerns is this idea that, you know, “guy is on a
   mission to save his wife,” or “guy is on a mission to avenge his wife,
   who was raped and killed.” “Now I’ll go take my vengeance,” right? Or,
   you know, “I’m gonna go back and save my wife.” And I wanted to
   undercut that as much as I possibly could. I wanted to call that into
   as a much question as I possibly could. You know? And so...like,
   violence as its deployed in storytelling in the west, it always has
   this resonance with machismo. And I was trying to really get away from
   that in the book.

   io9: Yeah, those tropes are also aligned with this kind of top-down
   distribution of power that’s inherently inequitable, right? The power
   structure gifts you violence, or you steal it from the power structure
   and inflict it upon the power structure, but it keeps on going in a
   cycle that ultimately dehumanizes all parties, I think. One of the
   things it feels like you’re doing is interrogating older American
   mythologies that we’ve been told to believe and creating new mythology
   from the counter-narrative stories that have always been there. You map
   out this taxonomy of the slaveholding South in the book: slave-hunters
   as a faction named Ryland, slaves are Tasking folk, plantation owners
   are Quality, working-class whites are Low, women whose bodies are sold
   for sex are Fancies. How did those influences you mentioned before—D&D,
   J.R.R. Tolkien, hip-hop, comics, science-fiction genre stuff—help you
   do that?

   Advertisement

   Coates: That’s what we do, you know what I mean? That’s an essential
   part of gaming, this idea of world-building. That’s what we do in hip
   hop. That’s how Staten Island became Shaolin. That’s in our brain. It’s
   how the police became One Time. That’s all throughout the literature,
   always being defined in different ways. So, me, that’s the stuff I came
   up on, man. I just drank that stuff. When you’re playing Dungeons &
   Dragons, the idea of naming things is so important, from naming your
   character, to what continent they’re named after and what world you’re
   playing in. All that stuff is so key. I didn’t have to think about it,
   it’s in my bones. And then there’s the other thing: People have a
   certain image when you say slavery. Certain things come to mind. And
   so, a large part of my job was to make slavery new. And part of making
   it new was new names.

   io9: The narration and dialogue in the book swings between
   colloquialism versus mannered speech. Sometimes it’s what you’d expect
   of the period and sometimes it isn’t. Talk to me about the
   considerations you had in deploying each one.

   Advertisement

   Coates: Well, you know what I had to get to, I had to figure out that
   this is a book inspired by a certain time period but it has to be
   readable to the people of today. So I was, more than anything, trying
   to evoke certain things but not necessarily be restricted by them. In
   earlier versions of trying to write the book, that wasn’t true. It’s
   more of an attempt to evoke than anything else. That’s really what I
   was trying to do.

   io9: There are times when it’s like, “You know, they probably didn’t
   sound like this back in the day...” but those moments between Hi and
   [surrogate parent] Thena did communicate a mother-son, familial kind of
   energy.

   Advertisement

   Coates: Yeah, that’s exactly it. It’s the feeling you’re going for. Not
   necessarily the exact thing, but the feeling.

   io9: Up until your comics work, most of your published writing had been
   memoir or socio-political commentary. How did that affect the long
   incubation period of this book?

   Advertisement

   Coates: I started this book before everything. Before Between the World
   and Me, before We Were Eight Years in Power, I was working on this. And
   it’s hard to learn to write fiction. [laughs] It’s hard to cultivate a
   new skill. When it’s not what you do, or have done. I’m just happy it
   wasn’t immediately published. I was talking to our mutual friend
   [editor] Chris [Jackson] last night because he was the first one who
   suggested writing fiction. He did that and my feeling was like, “I
   don’t understand this,” as far as craft. I would read fiction and not
   understand how this person made me feel like this actually happened and
   I really was there. I don’t get how they did that. And so it took a
   while, man. It just took a lot of writing that died and didn’t end up
   getting published to get there.

   io9: But I think all the stuff you were doing as non-fiction—it’s
   clearly evident there, you know?

   Advertisement

   Coates: It’s in there.

   io9: And there are parts of it that felt autobiographical, specifically
   Hi’s voracious reading and hunger to understand the larger forces
   demarcating his life.

   Advertisement

   Coates: Definitely, and also just thinking about the history and having
   to sit with the history for long periods of time. I mean, that was just
   the essential. It just was. I posted some stuff on Instagram this
   morning and what it was, was a lot of the documents I was reading. Oral
   testimonies, and then there’s places where that stuff just cuts off
   because it has to. And I would just find myself thinking, after reading
   that stuff, “Okay, what was that actually like?” What did that mean?
   What did it feel like?” And probably, the most exciting aspect of doing
   this fiction was getting into that mindset. Getting to a place where
   you could ask that question. And answer it.

   io9: History doesn’t always give us those answers, but fiction can. In
   the research, did you ever learn a fact that seemed too fantastical to
   be true?

   Coates: I felt like one of the biggest things was, I was shocked about
   how durable notions of family were. There is a notion among us, and
   among the wider public, that slavery destroyed traditional ideas—or not
   even traditional—healthy ideas of family. And I was shocked by how much
   of a myth [that] was. Everybody from black nationalists to white
   conservatives to white liberals say that. And it’s just a lie. An
   absolute, absolute lie. That was a big one.

   Advertisement

   io9: The importance of family is palpable throughout the book. I feel
   like the tension between collective and individual memory is a
   through-line throughout most of all your work. But also, I feel like
   something that really comes into sharp focus in The Water Dancer is
   that memory and history are two separate, distinct things. Can you talk
   about the mechanisms by which those two things become distinct?

   Coates: So, history is written and what actually “happened,” I guess.
   There’s a place in the book where Harriet Tubman says “There are
   certain stories I just can’t tell.” Like, “Why don’t you go down and
   save them with X, Y, and Z?” She actually can’t do that without
   specific memories! She’s Moses, not Jesus. And so, memory is the key in
   the book. Hiram, when he finally does Conduct and even the first
   Conduction early in the book, it’s a situation where these are things
   that happen that are part of the historical record, but are deeply
   personal to them. That’s what they can act on.

   Advertisement

   io9: That felt like you layering a rule set on top of these people’s
   powers.

   Coates: You got to. When you’re trying to do something and introduce an
   element of magic, you have to have boundaries. I had to do something
   like that.

   Advertisement

   io9: Just like how Nightcrawler can’t teleport anywhere, he’s got to
   have a line of sight.

   Coates: Line of sight. Or have been there before.

   io9: One of the things that really stuck out to me was Hi’s whole
   “college experience” on the mountain revival, where he encounters all
   these notions of freedom. Did you worry about anachronism in that
   sequence...

   Advertisement

   Coates: [laughs] That’s what it is, though. That’s a good term for it.
   It’s like going to college. No, I wasn’t worried because I read about
   that before I made that sequence. All that shit was actually going on.

   io9: That was the second part of my question. You kind of tease out,
   “these things we think about as new notions about men and women loving
   each other are not—”

   Coates: NO, EVAN! I read about that before I even decided to put that
   in the book! There’s a section in What Hath God Wrought, which is like
   a history of basically the antebellum period in America. And [author
   Daniel Walker Howe] talks about all these utopian movements. We think
   free love is something the hippies came up with, but it’s not. It’s not
   at all. It’s actually quite old. I knew all of that stuff was actually
   going on.

   Advertisement

   You hear about the early feminist movements and think that was
   definitely happening. But some of the crazier stuff in that part...this
   is the period Marx is alive, so Marxism is a thing that’s going on.
   Free love is a thing that’s going on. Child labor movements are alive
   and well. There’s somebody in those scenes who does a temperance thing
   about alcohol. That was a thing that was going on at that time. So, it
   was really interesting to me how abolition was the white-hot core of
   those movements. It brought all those disparate people together. But
   that, like, it wasn’t just abolition. There were all these other
   things, too. If you read about Frederick Douglass, he was talking about
   all these things. He’s talking about temperance and called himself “a
   woman’s rights man.” He wasn’t using the term feminism at the time, but
   said “a woman’s rights man,” which is a 19th century version of a male
   feminist.

   io9: Speaking of women’s rights and feminism, a lot of the conflicting
   tensions of that historical moment live inside Corinne, who’s just
   fascinating because she’s the subject of a different sort of
   oppression, yet she holds Hiram in another kind of bondage and debt.
   What was it like figuring out her character?

   Advertisement

   Coates: She’s an antagonist and an anti-hero, right? I think that’s
   basically what we’d say she is. So again, going back to the history,
   there are all these stories like the Grimke sisters where folks talk
   about white women talking about slavery and the fact that enslavement
   gave them insight into their own “slavery,” as women. So she comes out
   of that. And there was a woman by the name of Elizabeth Van Lew. She
   was in Richmond, Virginia. She was deep in Confederate circles but she
   was a spy for the Union. She had a black woman that worked with her. I
   mean, they spied on Jefferson Davis and shit. And I used to think that
   was fucking incredible. It’s incredible, the idea of a Union spy in the
   Confederacy during the Civil War, a black woman and a white woman,
   working together. That was sort of irresistible inspiration.

   io9: This book has been brewing for so long, way before you started
   writing comics. How did writing comics change the way you worked on The
   Water Dancer?

   Advertisement

   Coates: Oh, it helped a lot. The most modern version happened after
   Black Panther, so it definitely helped a lot. I think one of the big
   things was having to write that much dialogue and those themes. It
   helped a lot. Writing comics was just like practice for those things.

   Read more Read

   Advertisement

   io9: How I experienced it was you had these really tight encapsulations
   of scenes that felt very visual. I’ve read your comic scripts and
   they’ve gotten very lean. But this was a more muscular version of what
   you do in your comic scripts.

   Coates: That’s exactly it. It’s not that different, you know?

   io9: Has this book changed the way you write comics now?

   Coates: I think it’s the other way around. You know what I love about
   comics? If you’re doing it right, it has a kind of immediacy. You don’t
   have the option or the luxury you have in books, where you can just
   sort of sit back. So, I think comic book writing changed my aesthetic.
   It made me want to make the literature more immediate and not to waste
   people’s time. It’s still a novel but I tried as much as possible to
   get into things as quickly as I could. To get to action. And that’s
   something I got from the comic book writing.

   Advertisement

   io9: Do you think you could have told this story as a comic?

   Coates: I had this idea to do a prequel comic but a buddy of mine told
   me if I did that, I would be fucking up because I would have to show
   people what Conduction looked like before they got a chance to read the
   book. And he was saying, “You shouldn’t show them what it looks like.”
   You should let them imagine.

   Advertisement

   io9: Re-reading this book a second time, it made me think about what
   you’re doing with Captain America, where Steve has to figure out where
   his place is in the national psyche. You’re not the first person to
   have Steve wonder if he can manifest the best ideals of the country
   doing what he’s doing in the way he’s doing it. Why do you think that’s
   a recurring theme in Captain America stories over the decades?

   Coates: To me, a guy who just wants to bomb everything and shout
   “America!” wouldn’t be very interesting to me. What’s interesting to me
   is that a guy with a flag on his chest would actually be intelligent
   enough to see the flaws. Steve’s a sensitive dude, man. I think people
   forget that. Steve is an artist. And so, to me, the struggle Steve has
   is to love America as it is. He really loves it; he’s literally from
   the Greatest Generation. But he’s also having to constantly, in his own
   way, push the country to live out those ideals amidst the
   disappointment that they, in fact, do not. If I had actually take one
   panel and say “that’s the mission statement” for Captain America, as I
   write him? It’s that great panel [from Daredevil: Born Again] “I’m
   loyal to nothing except the dream.”

   (Marvel Comics)

   io9: I think one of the reasons Steve and T’Challa are such great
   partners, brothers to each other, is that they’re opposite sides to the
   same coin. Steve grew into the symbolism, but T’Challa had it thrust
   upon him and chafes under it.

   Advertisement

   Coates: He wanted it! Steve wanted it. He wanted the symbolism. He
   wanted to serve. To be that dude. T’Challa, like you say, was thrust
   upon it.

   io9: And again, the contrast is like...well, Steve has this initial
   naiveté and he has to learn about the flaws and foibles of how the
   American experiment is executed. T’Challa knows all that—about Wakanda
   and the rest of the world—going in.

   Advertisement

   Coates: He knows this world is flawed.

   io9: Last question. It seems like you’ve opened a horizon of
   possibility with The Water Dancer. Do you feel if there’s another one
   following this, it will be easier to write?

   Advertisement

   Coates: I think the thing is I don’t have to go find the voice again.
   Unless Hiram isn’t the storyteller. I think if I use Hiram, I don’t
   have to figure that out again. I was doing an interview with someone
   yesterday and they said, “Would you be happy with any fiction you did
   from here on out was just about slavery?” And I told that person it
   would have sounded crazy to me before, but there are so many goddamn
   stories. It’s just insane. So, you know, doing more with those stories
   wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.

   When it was reported that Joaquin Phoenix was either unprepared or
   unwilling to answer a rather straightforward question about Joker’s
   depiction of domestic terrorism, it suggested the actor, and by
   extension the studio, might have been uninterested in really engaging
   with the heavy subject matter being presented. But now, Phoenix and
   director Todd Phillips have a lot to say.

   In an interview, this time with IGN, it seems as if Phoenix and
   Phillips have not only spent some time contemplating how the public
   would receive Joker, they’ve also been paying attention to the way the
   conversation about the film has already taken such a distinct shape and
   tone despite the fact that most people have yet to see it.

Joker Is Powerful, Confused, and Provocative, Just Like the Character

   If Joker wasn’t called “Joker,” you’d never know it was a DC movie.
   Though there are characters…
   Read more Read

   While Phillips understands why people are inclined to form snap
   judgments, he really wishes that people would engage with the material
   first:

     “I really think there have been a lot of think pieces written by
     people who proudly state they haven’t even seen the movie and they
     don’t need to. I would just argue that you might want to watch the
     movie, you might want to watch it with an open mind.”

   Phillips also expressed his frustration with the way that so much of
   the Joker conversation has been shaped by a small group of critics and
   festival attendees with drastically varying opinions:

     “It’s so, to me, bizarre when people say, ‘Oh, well I could handle
     it. But imagine if you can’t.’ It’s making judgments for other
     people and I don’t even want to bring up the movies in the past that
     they’ve said this about because it’s shocking and embarrassing when
     you go, oh my God, Do the Right Thing, they said that about [that
     movie, too].”

   Advertisement

   While Phoenix didn’t comment on whether he thought Joker might be this
   generation’s Do the Right Thing, he did, interestingly enough, have a
   thoughtful response after being questioned about the movie’s potential
   to inspire people to emulate the villain:

     “The truth is you don’t know what is going to be the fuel for
     somebody. And it might very well be your question. It might be this
     moment, right? But you can’t function in life saying, ‘Well, I can’t
     ask that question for the small chance that somebody might be
     affected by [it].’ I wouldn’t ask you to do that.

     It’s uncomfortable. It’s uncomfortable for all of us. I think we all
     are aware of these issues and we’re concerned, and I think that’s
     why we talk about it. I don’t think that we can be afraid to talk
     about it. So I understand why you asked that question. But I think
     the same way that you feel that you need to ask that question and
     engage in the conversation this way, I think that’s how I feel as an
     actor. And that’s all I have to say.”

   Advertisement

   According to IGN’s original report, its interview took place before the
   Telegraph conversation where Phoenix froze up and left when presented
   with a similar question. That would have made the Telegraph reaction
   all the more curious. When we reached out to IGN as to how it could be
   certain that its interview took place first, executive editor Jim
   Vejvoda conceded that he could not and the site’s report has been
   subsequently updated to reflect that. It seems the actor and creator
   had time to sit on the question a bit more the next time it was
   broached.

How Joker Was Crafted to Leave You Speechless

   Everyone is talking about Joker.

   It’s understandable that Phillips and Phoenix would rather people form
   their own opinions about the movie, but their comments come at a time
   when the survivors of horrific gun violence are making a concerted
   effort to draw attention to the realities of the way the movie
   glamorizes its central character.

   According to the Hollywood Reporter, five people whose lives were
   devastated by the 2012 theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado recently
   signed a letter urging Warner Bros. to stop financially supporting any
   and all political figures who actively support the NRA and advocate
   against gun reform. But on a more personal level, Sandy Phillips, who
   became an advocate for the survivors of gun violence after her own
   daughter was slain in the Aurora shooting, says her issue with Joker is
   both visceral and personal:

     “I don’t need to see a picture of [James Holmes]; I just need to see
     a Joker promo and I see a picture of the killer.

     My worry is that one person who may be out there — and who knows if
     it is just one — who is on the edge, who is wanting to be a mass
     shooter, may be encouraged by this movie. And that terrifies me.”

   Advertisement

   Though the Aurora survivors aren’t aiming for Joker to be banned, the
   movie complex where the tragic shooting took place will not be
   screening the movie.

   UPDATE 9/24 4:20 PM: Warner Bros. has now officially responded to the
   calls from the Aurora survivors for the studio to distance itself from
   lawmakers who have resisted legislation that would result in stricter
   gun control. The studio did not say that it would stop supporting those
   kinds of politicians, but it did insist that Joker isn’t trying to
   frame the character as a hero:

     “Gun violence in our society is a critical issue, and we extend our
     deepest sympathy to all victims and families impacted by these
     tragedies. Our company has a long history of donating to victims of
     violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our parent company
     joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact
     bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic.

     At the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of
     storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex
     issues. Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor
     the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It
     is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to
     hold this character up as a hero. ”

   Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck.

   Because Todd Phillips’ Joker tells the relatively grounded story of a
   disaffected white man who goes on a terroristic rampage because he
   feels as if he’s been dealt a bad hand in life, there’s been an ongoing
   discussion about whether the movie has the potential to inspire certain
   viewers to model themselves (idealistically) after the titular villain.

   Even though the Joker is objectively made out to be the villain of his
   own film, it’d be disingenuous to say that he isn’t framed in a heroic
   way because the story being told is about his origins and ascendance.
   We know that the clown is destined to become one of Gotham’s most
   enduring threats and one of the few people capable of going toe-to-toe
   with Batman, and so the Joker’s on-screen actions, horrific though they
   made be, all build toward the idea of him becoming a powerful,
   important figure in society.

   Advertisement

   While the Joker movie is meant to be a critique of people like its
   central character, it’s easy to see how it could also be interpreted as
   a celebration of them—but, apparently, that idea never quite occurred
   to Joaquin Phoenix or Warner Bros. During a recent interview for a
   profile in the Telegraph, Phoenix allegedly stopped the conversation
   dead in its tracks after being asked whether he’d given any thought to
   the possibility that audiences might take the wrong message away from
   the movie.

Consummate Actor Joaquin Phoenix Allegedly Stormed Off the Joker Set a Lot

   From the sounds of it, Joaquin Phoenix’s behavior on the set of Todd
   Phillips’ Joker film was a far …
   Read more Read

   Rather than stopping to mull the question over, Phoenix simply left,
   much in the same way he was alleged to often do while shooting the film
   itself:

     “Yet Phoenix doesn’t seem to have considered this kind of question
     at all. So when I put it to him – aren’t you worried that this film
     might perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it’s
     about, with potentially tragic results? – his fight-or-flight
     response kicks in. Mine too, just about.

     It takes an hour’s peace-brokering with a Warner Bros PR to get
     things back on track. Phoenix panicked, he later explains, because
     the question genuinely hadn’t crossed his mind before – then asks
     me, not for the last time, what an intelligent answer might have
     sounded like.”

   Advertisement

   And no, Phoenix never answered the question.

   It seems unfathomable that Phoenix could have taken this role on
   without spending any time reflecting on the cultural landscape the
   movie exists in, given the actor’s reputation for diving deep into the
   essence of the characters that he plays. Even if he somehow managed put
   together his take on the Joker in a vacuum, it seems just as unlikely
   that this topic never came up during the movie’s production process, or
   that someone at Warner Bros. wouldn’t have thought to themselves “hmm,
   someone’s probably going to ask about the movie glorifying angry white
   men taking up arms.”

   Illustration for article titled Report: Spider-Man Will No Longer Be
   Shared by Marvel and Sony [Updated]

   Huge news in the world of superheroes. Deadline reports that Disney and
   Sony have come to a stalemate in regards to Spider-Man and that Marvel
   Studios, along with its president Kevin Feige, will no longer be
   producing Spider-Man films.

   This comes after Spider-Man: Far From Home, which is being re-released
   in a few weeks, became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time.

   Advertisement

   When contacted by io9, a Sony representative said it’s their belief
   this dispute is simply over a producer credit and negotiations are
   ongoing. They further clarified that Feige has contributed to other
   Spider-centric movies that he did not receive a producer credit on.
   Other sources tell us the Deadline story is completely accurate.
   [Update 8/21/2019: Sony has now released an official statement which
   you can read here.]

   Read more Read

   The issue, as you’d expect, is money. While Disney was happy to take
   only a small percentage of grosses on Spider-Man: Homecoming and
   Spider-Man: Far From Home (in exchange for Sony allowing Marvel to use
   the character in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War,
   and Avengers: Endgame), a debate among executives began to take place
   about the future. According to Deadline, Disney wanted to split profits
   50/50 but Sony didn’t even counter that.

   Two more Spider-Man films are reportedly in development, with both
   director Jon Watts and star Tom Holland attached. Plus, Sony has begun
   its own Spider-Man mini-universe thanks to huge hits like Venom and
   Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, both of which have sequels on the
   way. Rumor has it, Disney and Marvel were even hoping to help out with
   those films to further expand the crossover—but in the end, the studios
   simply asked for more than Sony was willing to give. Apparently, Sony
   feels it already has the big pieces in place, so the films will be fine
   without Feige. We’ll see how that goes.

   Advertisement

   Definitely head over to the Deadline piece to read more of the details
   but this is certainly a disappointing day for fans of the Marvel
   Cinematic Universe. Potentially removing Spider-Man leaves that tiny
   asterisk on a world that had just inherited the X-Men and Fantastic
   Four thanks to the Fox deal. For a brief moment, all of Marvel’s heroes
   were home. But now, it seems like Sony will make its Spider-Man movies
   on its own.

   The U.S. military has warned service members about the potential for a
   mass shooter at screenings of the Warner Bros. film Joker, which has
   sparked wide concerns from, among others, the families of those killed
   during the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado.

   The U.S. Army confirmed on Tuesday that the warning was widely
   distributed after social media posts related to extremists classified
   as “incels,” were uncovered by intelligence officials at the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation.

   Advertisement

   In a September 18th email, service members were instructed to remain
   aware of their surroundings and “identify two escape routes” when
   entering theaters. In the event of a shooting, they were instructed to
   “run, hide, fight.”

   “Run if you can,” the safety notice said. “If you’re stuck, hide (also
   known as ‘sheltering in place’), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds
   you, fight with whatever you can.”

   The Army said it became aware of potential threats after receiving a
   bulletin from the FBI, but that it was unaware of any specific plots or
   suspects. The notice, which was marked “For Official Use Only,” was
   relayed purely as a precautionary measure, it said.

   Advertisement

   A separate memo, issued on Monday by senior officials in the U.S.
   Army’s criminal investigation division, stated that the Army had
   obtained “credible” intelligence from Texas law enforcement officials
   pertaining to “disturbing and very specific chatter” on the dark web
   “regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the
   release.”

   “We do this routinely because the safety and security of our workforce
   is paramount,” an Army spokesperson said of the widely distributed
   warning. “We want our workforce to be prepared and diligent on personal
   safety both inside the workplace and out.”

   Advertisement

   Incel is a term that was adopted in the ‘90s by an online subgroup of
   self-professed “involuntary celibate” men. Over time, some radicalized
   members of the incel community have formed an ideology that promotes
   violence. Elliot Rodger self-identified as an incel before he killed
   six people near the campus of the University of California, Santa
   Barbara in 2014. And James Holmes, the man who opened fire in a crowded
   movie theater in 2012 has become a bit of a hero to the incel
   community. It’s often been repeated that Holmes was inspired by the
   Joker, a claim that primarily rests on statements the killer reportedly
   made to police after the fact in which he said he “was the Joker.”
   Speaking with the Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Oates, Aurora’s chief of
   police at the time, said that “there is no evidence” the shooter ever
   said that.

   In the alert emailed to service members, Army officials claimed that
   incels “also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the
   Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to be
   happy, but eventually fights back against bullies.”

   “While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence
   products, the FBI is in touch with our law enforcement and private
   sector partners about the online posts,” an FBI spokesperson said. “As
   always, we encourage the public to remain vigilant and to promptly
   report suspicious activity to law enforcement.”

   In an age of frequent mass shootings by predominately white American
   men—at least some of whom have referenced in writing their frustrations
   with sex—the film has sparked controversy over its desire to compel its
   audience (at least in its first half) to empathize with a mentally
   unbalanced and unloved “loser” who inevitably resorts to mass murder.

   The gritty film, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker, reportedly
   makes strides to depict its titular character in a far more realistic
   fashion than his comics counterpart. Rather than being transformed into
   the “Joker” after falling into a vat of acid—as the villain so often
   does in depictions of his DC Comics origin—a harsh life compounded by
   constant mockery and an inability to “get the girl” is what ultimately
   leads to his rise as the infamously batty executioner of comic book
   lore.

   The Hollywood Reporter reported Tuesday that families who lost
   relatives in the Aurora shooting, which claimed the lives of 12
   moviegoers in 2012 during a screening of the Batman film The Dark
   Knight Rises, signed a letter this week to Warner Bros. sharing
   concerns about the Joker film. With the film set to open on October
   4th, the families asked the legendary film studio to donate to groups
   that aid victims of gun violence.

   “We are calling on you to be a part of the growing chorus of corporate
   leaders who understand that they have a social responsibility to keep
   us all safe,” the letter reportedly says. The film will not be shown in
   the Colorado theater where the shooting occurred.

   Advertisement

   An Air Force officer at Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia—granted
   anonymity to discuss the Defense Department’s warning freely—said that
   such notices are occasionally circulated by security managers, but only
   when deemed “credible.” The officer said that in some cases, commanders
   may issue an advisory in response; however, one was not issued in this
   case.

   “Frankly, beyond the email, I’ve heard little about it,” the officer
   said. “A few folks said they’d avoid opening night, or passed it on to
   their family members for consideration, but I haven’t heard much else
   in conversation beyond that.”

   Advertisement

   Warner Bros. did not respond to a request for comment.

   In a statement broadly addressing the controversy over the film, Warner
   Bros. called gun violence a “critical issue” and said that in recent
   weeks it has called on policymakers to enact legislation to address
   what it called an “epidemic” of violence. Regardless, the purpose of
   storytelling, it said, was to “provoke difficult conversations around
   complex issues.” The company went on to make clear that the film does
   not endorse real-world violence and said that “it is not the intention
   of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as
   a hero.”

   Advertisement

   You can read the email that was circulated by the military in full
   below:

     Team,

     Posts on social media have made reference to involuntary celibate
     (“incel”) extremists replicating the 2012 theater shooting in
     Aurora, Colorado, at screenings of the Joker movie at nationwide
     theaters. This presents a potential risk to DOD personnel and family
     members, though there are no known specific credible threats to the
     opening of the Joker on 4 October.

     Incels are individuals who express frustration from perceived
     disadvantages to starting intimate relationships. Incel extremists
     idolize violent individuals like the Aurora movie theater shooter.
     They also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the
     Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to
     be happy, but eventually fights back against his bullies.

     When entering theaters, identify two escape routes, remain aware of
     your surroundings, and remember the phrase “run, hide, fight.” Run
     if you can. If you’re stuck, hide (also referred to as “sheltering
     in place”), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds you, fight with
     whatever you can.

   Last week, Ta-Nehisi Coates was in his kitchen, peeling and cutting
   carrots that his wife had brought from the farmer’s market. This week,
   he’s putting The Water Dancer—the novel that marks his literary fiction
   debut—out into the world. One of those things makes him very nervous.

   [Disclosure: I’ve known Ta-Nehisi for years and he was a consultant on
   the Rise of The Black Panther miniseries that I wrote for Marvel.]

   Chances are, if you know Coates’ name, it’s because of his non-fiction
   writing. Over the past 10 years, his books and articles like “The Case
   for Reparations,” “The First White President,” and Between The World
   And Me have explored how slavery and institutionalized racism have left
   behind legacies that America still needs to reckon with. While doing
   the writing that would win him awards, Coates would also blog about his
   love of superhero comics and his first published foray into fiction was
   writing Black Panther for Marvel.

   But, for 10 years, another unwieldy ambition was also cascading through
   his head: a novel that would try and fuse elements of all his passions
   into an altogether new whole. The Water Dancer is out this week from
   Penguin Random House and represents the end of a decade-long journey
   for Coates.

   The main character of The Water Dancer is Hiram “Hi” Walker, son of a
   slave-holding white man and the woman who was his property. As a young
   man, Hi begins to manifest a photographic memory and the gift of
   Conduction, a supernatural ability that might carry him and others to
   freedom if he learns to master it. But others in 19th Century Virginia
   know about Conduction, too, and Hi’s life falls into great complication
   and danger when he crosses paths with those who want to use him for
   their own ends.

   As we spoke on the phone last week, Coates was banging around in the
   kitchen while holding forth about the self-doubt, research, and
   rewriting that went into shaping The Water Dancer. The interview that
   follows is an edited, condensed version of our conversation.

     __________________________________________________________________

   io9: One of the things that strikes me about how you construct the
   suspense in the book is that it feels pulpy. The motivations are
   predicated on deep impulses and yearning. And Hi feels hot-headed at
   times, but you’ve also told me it was really important to minimize
   violence as a liberating tool. Why did this book have to be told in
   this specific way?

   Advertisement

   Ta-Nehisi Coates: Yeah, that’s actually a great question. Especially
   what you said about the pulpy part, because arguably, violence is
   always really important with pulpy fiction, the kind of storytelling
   you and I came up on. I felt two things. One: I am who I am. In terms
   of my influences. And my influences are quite well recorded. I played
   Dungeons & Dragons, I read comic books. I listened to hip-hop. Those
   are very Low Culture, you know what I mean? In terms of my fiction,
   those are the sort of things that stay with me. So, that was one thing.
   But there’s another conflicting thing that took some years to get to.
   One of the fascinating things about African American history is how it
   sits with the typical Western narrative of the hero. Often, the hero
   starts his rise and ends with killing his antagonist in a violent
   confrontation. And, a lot of times, that’s how heroes are built. And as
   a younger reader, I hungered for that from black folk.

   I always wondered why there weren’t black people who did that. But, as
   I read and researched, I actually realized a beautiful thing about
   black history in America: that very often, we have not had the recourse
   to violence and we had to triumph in other ways. Sorry, I’m opening
   this Isabel Wilkerson book [The Warmth of Other Suns] because she has
   this great quote that I think about all the time. She’s talking about
   resistance and black people and the Great Migration:

     “What binds these stories together was the back-against-the-wall,
     reluctant yet hopeful search for something better, any place but
     where they were. They did what human beings looking for freedom,
     throughout history, have often done. They left.”

   Advertisement

   And that was one of the first times I heard someone actively position
   the act of leaving, of running, as resistance. And that’s a theme all
   throughout history because we were enslaved, right? And so, on one
   level I was like, “Oh, I can tell a different kind of story”—not a
   story about how he comes back and kills his master and claims his
   woman, you know what I mean? One where violence is not really possible,
   so now your hero has to resort to other means. And that, to me, was a
   thrilling way to tell a story.

   Because you can feel certain things, but never really act on them. And
   there’s a gender component to that, too. Because in many ways I wanted
   to write a Western. I love Westerns. An adventure story, you know? But
   one of the tropes of Westerns is this idea that, you know, “guy is on a
   mission to save his wife,” or “guy is on a mission to avenge his wife,
   who was raped and killed.” “Now I’ll go take my vengeance,” right? Or,
   you know, “I’m gonna go back and save my wife.” And I wanted to
   undercut that as much as I possibly could. I wanted to call that into
   as a much question as I possibly could. You know? And so...like,
   violence as its deployed in storytelling in the west, it always has
   this resonance with machismo. And I was trying to really get away from
   that in the book.

HBOʼs Lovecraft Country Could Be Everything Green Book Wasnʼt

   There are as many valid criticisms of Peter Farrelly’s Best Picture
   Oscar-winner Green Book as…
   Read more Read

   io9: Yeah, those tropes are also aligned with this kind of top-down
   distribution of power that’s inherently inequitable, right? The power
   structure gifts you violence, or you steal it from the power structure
   and inflict it upon the power structure, but it keeps on going in a
   cycle that ultimately dehumanizes all parties, I think. One of the
   things it feels like you’re doing is interrogating older American
   mythologies that we’ve been told to believe and creating new mythology
   from the counter-narrative stories that have always been there. You map
   out this taxonomy of the slaveholding South in the book: slave-hunters
   as a faction named Ryland, slaves are Tasking folk, plantation owners
   are Quality, working-class whites are Low, women whose bodies are sold
   for sex are Fancies. How did those influences you mentioned before—D&D,
   J.R.R. Tolkien, hip-hop, comics, science-fiction genre stuff—help you
   do that?

   Advertisement

   Coates: That’s what we do, you know what I mean? That’s an essential
   part of gaming, this idea of world-building. That’s what we do in hip
   hop. That’s how Staten Island became Shaolin. That’s in our brain. It’s
   how the police became One Time. That’s all throughout the literature,
   always being defined in different ways. So, me, that’s the stuff I came
   up on, man. I just drank that stuff. When you’re playing Dungeons &
   Dragons, the idea of naming things is so important, from naming your
   character, to what continent they’re named after and what world you’re
   playing in. All that stuff is so key. I didn’t have to think about it,
   it’s in my bones. And then there’s the other thing: People have a
   certain image when you say slavery. Certain things come to mind. And
   so, a large part of my job was to make slavery new. And part of making
   it new was new names.

   io9: The narration and dialogue in the book swings between
   colloquialism versus mannered speech. Sometimes it’s what you’d expect
   of the period and sometimes it isn’t. Talk to me about the
   considerations you had in deploying each one.

   Advertisement

   Coates: Well, you know what I had to get to, I had to figure out that
   this is a book inspired by a certain time period but it has to be
   readable to the people of today. So I was, more than anything, trying
   to evoke certain things but not necessarily be restricted by them. In
   earlier versions of trying to write the book, that wasn’t true. It’s
   more of an attempt to evoke than anything else. That’s really what I
   was trying to do.

   io9: There are times when it’s like, “You know, they probably didn’t
   sound like this back in the day...” but those moments between Hi and
   [surrogate parent] Thena did communicate a mother-son, familial kind of
   energy.

   Advertisement

   Coates: Yeah, that’s exactly it. It’s the feeling you’re going for. Not
   necessarily the exact thing, but the feeling.

   io9: Up until your comics work, most of your published writing had been
   memoir or socio-political commentary. How did that affect the long
   incubation period of this book?

   Advertisement

   Coates: I started this book before everything. Before Between the World
   and Me, before We Were Eight Years in Power, I was working on this. And
   it’s hard to learn to write fiction. [laughs] It’s hard to cultivate a
   new skill. When it’s not what you do, or have done. I’m just happy it
   wasn’t immediately published. I was talking to our mutual friend
   [editor] Chris [Jackson] last night because he was the first one who
   suggested writing fiction. He did that and my feeling was like, “I
   don’t understand this,” as far as craft. I would read fiction and not
   understand how this person made me feel like this actually happened and
   I really was there. I don’t get how they did that. And so it took a
   while, man. It just took a lot of writing that died and didn’t end up
   getting published to get there.

   io9: But I think all the stuff you were doing as non-fiction—it’s
   clearly evident there, you know?

   Advertisement

   Coates: It’s in there.

   io9: And there are parts of it that felt autobiographical, specifically
   Hi’s voracious reading and hunger to understand the larger forces
   demarcating his life.

   Advertisement

   Coates: Definitely, and also just thinking about the history and having
   to sit with the history for long periods of time. I mean, that was just
   the essential. It just was. I posted some stuff on Instagram this
   morning and what it was, was a lot of the documents I was reading. Oral
   testimonies, and then there’s places where that stuff just cuts off
   because it has to. And I would just find myself thinking, after reading
   that stuff, “Okay, what was that actually like?” What did that mean?
   What did it feel like?” And probably, the most exciting aspect of doing
   this fiction was getting into that mindset. Getting to a place where
   you could ask that question. And answer it.

   io9: History doesn’t always give us those answers, but fiction can. In
   the research, did you ever learn a fact that seemed too fantastical to
   be true?

   Coates: I felt like one of the biggest things was, I was shocked about
   how durable notions of family were. There is a notion among us, and
   among the wider public, that slavery destroyed traditional ideas—or not
   even traditional—healthy ideas of family. And I was shocked by how much
   of a myth [that] was. Everybody from black nationalists to white
   conservatives to white liberals say that. And it’s just a lie. An
   absolute, absolute lie. That was a big one.

   Advertisement

   io9: The importance of family is palpable throughout the book. I feel
   like the tension between collective and individual memory is a
   through-line throughout most of all your work. But also, I feel like
   something that really comes into sharp focus in The Water Dancer is
   that memory and history are two separate, distinct things. Can you talk
   about the mechanisms by which those two things become distinct?

   Coates: So, history is written and what actually “happened,” I guess.
   There’s a place in the book where Harriet Tubman says “There are
   certain stories I just can’t tell.” Like, “Why don’t you go down and
   save them with X, Y, and Z?” She actually can’t do that without
   specific memories! She’s Moses, not Jesus. And so, memory is the key in
   the book. Hiram, when he finally does Conduct and even the first
   Conduction early in the book, it’s a situation where these are things
   that happen that are part of the historical record, but are deeply
   personal to them. That’s what they can act on.

   Advertisement

   io9: That felt like you layering a rule set on top of these people’s
   powers.

   Coates: You got to. When you’re trying to do something and introduce an
   element of magic, you have to have boundaries. I had to do something
   like that.

   Advertisement

   io9: Just like how Nightcrawler can’t teleport anywhere, he’s got to
   have a line of sight.

   Coates: Line of sight. Or have been there before.

   io9: One of the things that really stuck out to me was Hi’s whole
   “college experience” on the mountain revival, where he encounters all
   these notions of freedom. Did you worry about anachronism in that
   sequence...

   Advertisement

   Coates: [laughs] That’s what it is, though. That’s a good term for it.
   It’s like going to college. No, I wasn’t worried because I read about
   that before I made that sequence. All that shit was actually going on.

   io9: That was the second part of my question. You kind of tease out,
   “these things we think about as new notions about men and women loving
   each other are not—”

   Coates: NO, EVAN! I read about that before I even decided to put that
   in the book! There’s a section in What Hath God Wrought, which is like
   a history of basically the antebellum period in America. And [author
   Daniel Walker Howe] talks about all these utopian movements. We think
   free love is something the hippies came up with, but it’s not. It’s not
   at all. It’s actually quite old. I knew all of that stuff was actually
   going on.

   Advertisement

   You hear about the early feminist movements and think that was
   definitely happening. But some of the crazier stuff in that part...this
   is the period Marx is alive, so Marxism is a thing that’s going on.
   Free love is a thing that’s going on. Child labor movements are alive
   and well. There’s somebody in those scenes who does a temperance thing
   about alcohol. That was a thing that was going on at that time. So, it
   was really interesting to me how abolition was the white-hot core of
   those movements. It brought all those disparate people together. But
   that, like, it wasn’t just abolition. There were all these other
   things, too. If you read about Frederick Douglass, he was talking about
   all these things. He’s talking about temperance and called himself “a
   woman’s rights man.” He wasn’t using the term feminism at the time, but
   said “a woman’s rights man,” which is a 19th century version of a male
   feminist.

   io9: Speaking of women’s rights and feminism, a lot of the conflicting
   tensions of that historical moment live inside Corinne, who’s just
   fascinating because she’s the subject of a different sort of
   oppression, yet she holds Hiram in another kind of bondage and debt.
   What was it like figuring out her character?

   Advertisement

   Coates: She’s an antagonist and an anti-hero, right? I think that’s
   basically what we’d say she is. So again, going back to the history,
   there are all these stories like the Grimke sisters where folks talk
   about white women talking about slavery and the fact that enslavement
   gave them insight into their own “slavery,” as women. So she comes out
   of that. And there was a woman by the name of Elizabeth Van Lew. She
   was in Richmond, Virginia. She was deep in Confederate circles but she
   was a spy for the Union. She had a black woman that worked with her. I
   mean, they spied on Jefferson Davis and shit. And I used to think that
   was fucking incredible. It’s incredible, the idea of a Union spy in the
   Confederacy during the Civil War, a black woman and a white woman,
   working together. That was sort of irresistible inspiration.

   io9: This book has been brewing for so long, way before you started
   writing comics. How did writing comics change the way you worked on The
   Water Dancer?

   Advertisement

   Coates: Oh, it helped a lot. The most modern version happened after
   Black Panther, so it definitely helped a lot. I think one of the big
   things was having to write that much dialogue and those themes. It
   helped a lot. Writing comics was just like practice for those things.

   Advertisement

   io9: How I experienced it was you had these really tight encapsulations
   of scenes that felt very visual. I’ve read your comic scripts and
   they’ve gotten very lean. But this was a more muscular version of what
   you do in your comic scripts.

   Coates: That’s exactly it. It’s not that different, you know?

   io9: Has this book changed the way you write comics now?

   Coates: I think it’s the other way around. You know what I love about
   comics? If you’re doing it right, it has a kind of immediacy. You don’t
   have the option or the luxury you have in books, where you can just
   sort of sit back. So, I think comic book writing changed my aesthetic.
   It made me want to make the literature more immediate and not to waste
   people’s time. It’s still a novel but I tried as much as possible to
   get into things as quickly as I could. To get to action. And that’s
   something I got from the comic book writing.

   Advertisement

   io9: Do you think you could have told this story as a comic?

   Coates: I had this idea to do a prequel comic but a buddy of mine told
   me if I did that, I would be fucking up because I would have to show
   people what Conduction looked like before they got a chance to read the
   book. And he was saying, “You shouldn’t show them what it looks like.”
   You should let them imagine.

   Advertisement

   io9: Re-reading this book a second time, it made me think about what
   you’re doing with Captain America, where Steve has to figure out where
   his place is in the national psyche. You’re not the first person to
   have Steve wonder if he can manifest the best ideals of the country
   doing what he’s doing in the way he’s doing it. Why do you think that’s
   a recurring theme in Captain America stories over the decades?

   Coates: To me, a guy who just wants to bomb everything and shout
   “America!” wouldn’t be very interesting to me. What’s interesting to me
   is that a guy with a flag on his chest would actually be intelligent
   enough to see the flaws. Steve’s a sensitive dude, man. I think people
   forget that. Steve is an artist. And so, to me, the struggle Steve has
   is to love America as it is. He really loves it; he’s literally from
   the Greatest Generation. But he’s also having to constantly, in his own
   way, push the country to live out those ideals amidst the
   disappointment that they, in fact, do not. If I had actually take one
   panel and say “that’s the mission statement” for Captain America, as I
   write him? It’s that great panel [from Daredevil: Born Again] “I’m
   loyal to nothing except the dream.”

   (Marvel Comics)

   io9: I think one of the reasons Steve and T’Challa are such great
   partners, brothers to each other, is that they’re opposite sides to the
   same coin. Steve grew into the symbolism, but T’Challa had it thrust
   upon him and chafes under it.

   Advertisement

   Coates: He wanted it! Steve wanted it. He wanted the symbolism. He
   wanted to serve. To be that dude. T’Challa, like you say, was thrust
   upon it.

   io9: And again, the contrast is like...well, Steve has this initial
   naiveté and he has to learn about the flaws and foibles of how the
   American experiment is executed. T’Challa knows all that—about Wakanda
   and the rest of the world—going in.

   Advertisement

   Coates: He knows this world is flawed.

   io9: Last question. It seems like you’ve opened a horizon of
   possibility with The Water Dancer. Do you feel if there’s another one
   following this, it will be easier to write?

   Advertisement

   Coates: I think the thing is I don’t have to go find the voice again.
   Unless Hiram isn’t the storyteller. I think if I use Hiram, I don’t
   have to figure that out again. I was doing an interview with someone
   yesterday and they said, “Would you be happy with any fiction you did
   from here on out was just about slavery?” And I told that person it
   would have sounded crazy to me before, but there are so many goddamn
   stories. It’s just insane. So, you know, doing more with those stories
   wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.

   When it was reported that Joaquin Phoenix was either unprepared or
   unwilling to answer a rather straightforward question about Joker’s
   depiction of domestic terrorism, it suggested the actor, and by
   extension the studio, might have been uninterested in really engaging
   with the heavy subject matter being presented. But now, Phoenix and
   director Todd Phillips have a lot to say.

   In an interview, this time with IGN, it seems as if Phoenix and
   Phillips have not only spent some time contemplating how the public
   would receive Joker, they’ve also been paying attention to the way the
   conversation about the film has already taken such a distinct shape and
   tone despite the fact that most people have yet to see it.

Joker Is Powerful, Confused, and Provocative, Just Like the Character

   If Joker wasn’t called “Joker,” you’d never know it was a DC movie.
   Though there are characters…

   While Phillips understands why people are inclined to form snap
   judgments, he really wishes that people would engage with the material
   first:

     “I really think there have been a lot of think pieces written by
     people who proudly state they haven’t even seen the movie and they
     don’t need to. I would just argue that you might want to watch the
     movie, you might want to watch it with an open mind.”

   Phillips also expressed his frustration with the way that so much of
   the Joker conversation has been shaped by a small group of critics and
   festival attendees with drastically varying opinions:

     “It’s so, to me, bizarre when people say, ‘Oh, well I could handle
     it. But imagine if you can’t.’ It’s making judgments for other
     people and I don’t even want to bring up the movies in the past that
     they’ve said this about because it’s shocking and embarrassing when
     you go, oh my God, Do the Right Thing, they said that about [that
     movie, too].”

   While Phoenix didn’t comment on whether he thought Joker might be this
   generation’s Do the Right Thing, he did, interestingly enough, have a
   thoughtful response after being questioned about the movie’s potential
   to inspire people to emulate the villain:

     “The truth is you don’t know what is going to be the fuel for
     somebody. And it might very well be your question. It might be this
     moment, right? But you can’t function in life saying, ‘Well, I can’t
     ask that question for the small chance that somebody might be
     affected by [it].’ I wouldn’t ask you to do that.

     It’s uncomfortable. It’s uncomfortable for all of us. I think we all
     are aware of these issues and we’re concerned, and I think that’s
     why we talk about it. I don’t think that we can be afraid to talk
     about it. So I understand why you asked that question. But I think
     the same way that you feel that you need to ask that question and
     engage in the conversation this way, I think that’s how I feel as an
     actor. And that’s all I have to say.”

   According to IGN’s original report, its interview took place before the
   Telegraph conversation where Phoenix froze up and left when presented
   with a similar question. That would have made the Telegraph reaction
   all the more curious. When we reached out to IGN as to how it could be
   certain that its interview took place first, executive editor Jim
   Vejvoda conceded that he could not and the site’s report has been
   subsequently updated to reflect that. It seems the actor and creator
   had time to sit on the question a bit more the next time it was
   broached.

How Joker Was Crafted to Leave You Speechless

   Everyone is talking about Joker.

   It’s understandable that Phillips and Phoenix would rather people form
   their own opinions about the movie, but their comments come at a time
   when the survivors of horrific gun violence are making a concerted
   effort to draw attention to the realities of the way the movie
   glamorizes its central character.

   According to the Hollywood Reporter, five people whose lives were
   devastated by the 2012 theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado recently
   signed a letter urging Warner Bros. to stop financially supporting any
   and all political figures who actively support the NRA and advocate
   against gun reform. But on a more personal level, Sandy Phillips, who
   became an advocate for the survivors of gun violence after her own
   daughter was slain in the Aurora shooting, says her issue with Joker is
   both visceral and personal:

     “I don’t need to see a picture of [James Holmes]; I just need to see
     a Joker promo and I see a picture of the killer.

     My worry is that one person who may be out there — and who knows if
     it is just one — who is on the edge, who is wanting to be a mass
     shooter, may be encouraged by this movie. And that terrifies me.”

   Though the Aurora survivors aren’t aiming for Joker to be banned, the
   movie complex where the tragic shooting took place will not be
   screening the movie.

   UPDATE 9/24 4:20 PM: Warner Bros. has now officially responded to the
   calls from the Aurora survivors for the studio to distance itself from
   lawmakers who have resisted legislation that would result in stricter
   gun control. The studio did not say that it would stop supporting those
   kinds of politicians, but it did insist that Joker isn’t trying to
   frame the character as a hero:

     “Gun violence in our society is a critical issue, and we extend our
     deepest sympathy to all victims and families impacted by these
     tragedies. Our company has a long history of donating to victims of
     violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our parent company
     joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact
     bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic.

     At the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of
     storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex
     issues. Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor
     the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It
     is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to
     hold this character up as a hero. ”

   Because Todd Phillips’ Joker tells the relatively grounded story of a
   disaffected white man who goes on a terroristic rampage because he
   feels as if he’s been dealt a bad hand in life, there’s been an ongoing
   discussion about whether the movie has the potential to inspire certain
   viewers to model themselves (idealistically) after the titular villain.

   Even though the Joker is objectively made out to be the villain of his
   own film, it’d be disingenuous to say that he isn’t framed in a heroic
   way because the story being told is about his origins and ascendance.
   We know that the clown is destined to become one of Gotham’s most
   enduring threats and one of the few people capable of going toe-to-toe
   with Batman, and so the Joker’s on-screen actions, horrific though they
   made be, all build toward the idea of him becoming a powerful,
   important figure in society.

   While the Joker movie is meant to be a critique of people like its
   central character, it’s easy to see how it could also be interpreted as
   a celebration of them—but, apparently, that idea never quite occurred
   to Joaquin Phoenix or Warner Bros. During a recent interview for a
   profile in the Telegraph, Phoenix allegedly stopped the conversation
   dead in its tracks after being asked whether he’d given any thought to
   the possibility that audiences might take the wrong message away from
   the movie.

Consummate Actor Joaquin Phoenix Allegedly Stormed Off the Joker Set a Lot

   From the sounds of it, Joaquin Phoenix’s behavior on the set of Todd
   Phillips’ Joker film was a far …
   Read more Read

   Rather than stopping to mull the question over, Phoenix simply left,
   much in the same way he was alleged to often do while shooting the film
   itself:

     “Yet Phoenix doesn’t seem to have considered this kind of question
     at all. So when I put it to him – aren’t you worried that this film
     might perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it’s
     about, with potentially tragic results? – his fight-or-flight
     response kicks in. Mine too, just about.

     It takes an hour’s peace-brokering with a Warner Bros PR to get
     things back on track. Phoenix panicked, he later explains, because
     the question genuinely hadn’t crossed his mind before – then asks
     me, not for the last time, what an intelligent answer might have
     sounded like.”

   And no, Phoenix never answered the question.

   It seems unfathomable that Phoenix could have taken this role on
   without spending any time reflecting on the cultural landscape the
   movie exists in, given the actor’s reputation for diving deep into the
   essence of the characters that he plays. Even if he somehow managed put
   together his take on the Joker in a vacuum, it seems just as unlikely
   that this topic never came up during the movie’s production process, or
   that someone at Warner Bros. wouldn’t have thought to themselves “hmm,
   someone’s probably going to ask about the movie glorifying angry white
   men taking up arms.”
