While the World Watches Trump's Wall, Europe is Colluding in Rape and Torture
of Refugees | Opinion

   By Matteo de Bellis On 3/07/19 at 12:12 PM EST

   Farah, a young man from Somalia, his wife and newborn daughter had been
   at sea for 12 hours when the Libyan coastguard intercepted their
   dinghy. The couple had fled Libya after enduring several months of
   torture in a hangar where Farah was beaten and his wife raped in an
   attempt by Libyan gangs to extract ransom money from their relatives.

   When he realized he was being sent back to Libya, the 24-year-old felt
   sick to his stomach. "I knew it was better to die than to go back, but
   they threatened us with guns."

   Farah, his wife and baby spent the next seven months in two detention
   centres in Tripoli. "There was no food or support for my baby. She died
   when she was eight months old. Her name was Sagal."

   This is just one of several heartbreaking stories of violence and
   unimaginable cruelty I heard last month in Medenine, a small town in
   southern Tunisia, which has received a low but steady number of
   refugees and migrants escaping a hellish life across the border.

   This weekend fresh accounts emerged of people being tortured in
   Tripoli's Triq al Sikka detention centre. According to reports, over 20
   refugees and migrants, including children, were brought to an
   underground cell and then tortured at turns, one-by one, for days, in
   punishment for protesting against their arbitrary detention in squalid
   conditions and the lack of solutions. In response to the protest, over
   a hundred other detainees were transferred to other detention centres,
   including Ain Zara – which is where Sagal died.

   These stories of abuse correspond with what I heard in Tunisia. Another
   Somali man, Abdi, described extortion and beatings at the hands of
   detention centre guards. Like Farah, Abdi was also captured at sea by
   the Libyan coastguard and returned to Libya where he was moved from one
   detention centre to another.

   "Sometimes the guards drink and smoke, and then beat people. The guards
   also ask people to pay money to release them, but if you don't pay,
   they beat you. You would see the guards, both militia and police,
   coming in and beating people who had not paid."

   Catastrophic impact of Europe's migration policies

   Most of the people currently held in Libya's detention centres were
   intercepted at sea by the Libyan coastguard, which has enjoyed all kind
   of support from European governments in exchange for preventing
   refugees and migrants from reaching European shores.

   Through the donation of ships, the setting up of a Libyan search and
   rescue zone, and the construction of coordination centres , among other
   measures, European taxpayers' money has been used to enhance the Libyan
   capacity to block people attempting to flee Libya and hold them in
   unlawful detention. And this was done with no conditions attached, even
   if such cooperation results in gross human rights violations like
   torture.

   If EU states want to stop being complicit in the beatings, rape and
   exploitation of women, men and children, they must demand the closure
   of all detention centres in Libya and the release of the about 5,000
   people currently detained there.

   European governments that have acted for years in a frenzy, pushing
   through policies designed to stop arrivals in Europe whatever the human
   cost, should come to their senses, at least now that crossings are very
   low. Beyond action to address the human rights crisis in the country
   affecting Libyans and foreign nationals alike, the response needs to
   include a swift and predictable mechanism for the disembarkation in
   Europe of asylum-seekers and migrant rescued in the Mediterranean, as
   well as a fair system to share responsibility among EU countries for
   their assistance.

   Such measures would go some way to preventing the disastrous scenes
   that have been repeated over the past year – of rescue ships being left
   at sea for weeks with no EU country willing to open its ports to
   receive them. Such incidents not only add up to the suffering of people
   who have just fled horrific treatment, but also discourage merchant
   ships from rescuing people in distress and ensuring their
   disembarkation in a place of safety, which cannot be in Libya.

   Emmanuel, a 28-year-old refugee who fled conflict in Cameroon,
   described being adrift at sea in a dinghy which was in sight of another
   one that was floundering in the water, and his utter disbelief when a
   ship refused to rescue either boat.

   "From the big ship they were making calls, but said: 'Sorry, we can't
   take you, it's not my fault, orders are that Libyans will come to take
   you'. Meanwhile, I could see people dying on the other boat, pieces of
   boat were floating and bodies too. [By the time] a small Libyan ship
   came to get us...all the people on the other dinghy had died."

   With reports that refugees from countries such as Eritrea are
   returning, despite the obvious risks to their lives back home, Europe
   cannot afford to ignore the catastrophic consequences of its
   irresponsible policies to stem migration across the Med.

   As departures from Libya fall, now is the time to push for change: for
   an end to immigration detention centres in Libya, for a fair
   disembarkation and relocation mechanism in Europe, and for safe and
   legal avenues for people to find safety without resorting to sea
   crossings.

   This would result in many more children and adults being released from
   their ordeal and allowed to leave the horrific centres where they are
   currently being arbitrarily detained in Libya. European governments,
   that have closed the central Mediterranean route and so trapped
   thousands of people in Libya, have no time to lose.

   There are dozens of other Sagals, of other fathers and mothers, we
   could help to save.

American Airlines Accused of Racial Profiling After Two Muslim Men Had Flight
Canceled Because Crew Members 'Were Not Comfortable' Flying With Them

   By Brendan Cole On 9/20/19 at 4:32 AM EDT
   U.S. Dallas

   Two Muslim air passengers say they were targeted by the plane's cabin
   crew because of their race and religion.

   Abderraoof Alkhawaldeh and Issam Abdallah say American Airlines should
   be investigated over a "humiliating" incident that took place while
   waiting for take-off on board a plane in Birmingham, Alabama, bound for
   Dallas, Texas on September 14.

   The men, both members of the local Muslim community, were traveling
   separately. When onboard the flight operated by regional carrier Mesa
   Airlines, they spotted each other and waved. There was then a cabin
   announcement that the flight had been delayed.

   While they were waiting, Abdallah went to the bathroom. He said when he
   came out, a flight attendant was standing by the door "like she was
   eavesdropping".

   Airport on August 24, 2019 in this illustrative image. Two Muslim men
   have complained they were racially profiled on a flight on the
   airline.Bruce Bennett/Getty

   Passengers were then informed that the flight had been canceled and
   they had to leave the plane. They were put on another flight.

   However, after disembarking, officers, including an FBI agent,
   approached the pair. They then took Abdallah into a private room where
   they questioned him.

   When he demanded to know what was happening, Abdallah was told that
   airline staff had called the police because they were "not comfortable
   flying" with him.

   They said they became suspicious when Abdallah "went to the restroom
   and... flushed twice."

   "It was the most humiliating day of my life," he added.

   The agent apologized and Abdallah was let go and put on a rescheduled
   flight, but he remained upset by the incident.

   "I felt [they were] discriminating against my ethnicity, my religion,"
   Abdallah said in a news conference organized by the Council for
   American-Islamic Relations broadcast on Facebook.

   Alkhawaldeh said: "I have taken hundreds of flights and to be treated
   with such disrespect, suspicion, to be questioned in public and to be
   singled out and followed around in front of other airport customers—I
   am really worried as to what my next flying experience will be."

   Imam Omar Suleiman, a community leader in North Texas who attended the
   press conference, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "This happens
   often. Most of the time people do not step forward to talk about their
   experiences. Instead of just addressing this issue in isolation,
   American Airlines could use this opportunity to create protocols that
   stops this from happening all the time."

   The two men have asked that the Department of Transportation carry out
   an investigation.

   In a statement, American Airlines said: "We're committed to providing a
   positive experience to everyone who travels with us.

   "Our team is working with Mesa to review this incident, and we have
   reached out to Mr. Alkhawaldeh and Mr. Abdallah to better understand
   their experience," the BBC reported them as saying.

   The airline has faced accusations of discrimination before. Earlier
   this year, the airline had to apologize after it told a woman to hide
   her outfit.

   Tisha Rowe, 37, said she was flying from Kingston, Jamaica, to Miami,
   Florida, with her 8-year-old son when she was told to cover up her
   "assets" in an incident she described on Twitter as being racially
   motivated. "We are policed for being black," she tweeted.

   In 2017, The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
   (NAACP) warned African-Americans they could face "disrespectful,
   discriminatory or unsafe conditions" with American Airlines, according
   to The New York Times.

   This warning was lifted last July after the airline said it had given
   training to staff and put in a new complaint process.

Gaza Crisis: Lives of Territory's Critically Ill Hanging In The Balance

   By Rachel Borrell On 7/12/17 at 12:47 PM EDT

   This week the U.N. warned that conditions in the Gaza Strip have passed
   the threshold of "unliveable," 10 years since Israel's brutal land, sea
   and air blockade was first imposed. With the electricity supply
   drastically slashed and unemployment skyrocketing to 60 percent, many
   aspects of life have deteriorated even faster than originally
   projected. Gaza's health system in particular has been on the brink of
   collapse for years. Now it has reached crisis point.

   U.S. Calls On Americans To Leave Gaza ‘As Soon As Possible’

   In the last few weeks three newborn babies died in the intensive care
   unit at Gaza's al-Shifa hospital. They are among at least nine patients
   who have died in Gaza this year while waiting in vain for the
   Palestinian authorities in the West Bank to process requests for funds
   to cover the cost of their medical treatment outside the Gaza Strip.
   Obtaining this financial cover is essential for Gazans seeking to apply
   for a permit to cross the Erez border crossing into Israel, or get to
   the West Bank, for medical treatment.

   Some reports suggest that since April such requests have been
   deliberately ignored and delayed, as they have been periodically in the
   past, in attempts by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank to
   undermine the rival Hamas de facto authorities, which control the Gaza
   Strip.

   Abu Khalil and his family are just some of the thousands of Gazans
   whose lives have been put on hold as a result of such delays.

   Two of his sons—Abdallah, 27 and Khalil, 29—suffer from the inherited
   blood disorder Thalassaemia. The two men have had repeated blood
   transfusions leading to excess iron in their bloodstreams, putting them
   at risk of heart failure as well as other health complications. Two of
   their friends, suffering from the same treatable condition, died in
   June, and Abu Khalil has been desperately trying to ensure that his
   sons receive adequate care before it is too late.

   An Israeli doctor has offered to run tests on the brothers at Sheba
   Medical Center in Israel in order to assess them for potential bone
   marrow transplants which, if successful, could cure their Thalassaemia.
   This treatment is not available in Gaza, where hospitals are operating
   on diminished stocks of medication and minimal electricity.

   However, navigating the complex web of bureaucratic hurdles in order to
   get his sons transferred to Israel is a formidable challenge. First,
   Abu Khalil must obtain the commitment from the Palestinian authorities
   in the West Bank to underwrite the cost of his sons' treatment in
   Israel.

   There are at least 1,600 Gazans, including cancer patients, currently
   awaiting a response to their requests for financial coverage from the
   Palestinian authorities according to Physicians for Human Rights
   Israel. Up to 90 percent of cancer medicines are also no longer
   available in Gaza.

   After an outcry in the media, the Palestinian authorities appeared to
   resume the practice of underwriting medical costs on 2 July, allowing
   Gazan patients to apply for permits.

   For Abu Khalil this has offered only the smallest glimmer of hope. The
   Palestinian referrals application office in Gaza could not cover funds
   for both sons to travel to Israel for treatment, so he has had to
   prioritise Khalil, whose situation is more critical. The older brother
   must now begin the laborious process of undergoing a new set of blood
   tests. He will be forced to wait yet another week before those results
   are sent with his application to the West Bank, where a committee will
   decide whether he can even begin the process of applying for a permit
   to cross into Israel for treatment.

   Since the start of the year, Israel has also placed even more stringent
   limits on the number of permits provided to Palestinians from Gaza
   wishing to cross into Israel and is particularly reluctant to grant
   permits to young men.

   While Abu Khalil navigates the myriad of complex obstacles standing
   between him and his sons' much-needed medical treatment, their health
   will continue to deteriorate.

   "You can live without electricity, or survive in the most difficult
   situation but not being able to… get them treatment is unbearable. I
   live in fear of losing my sons at any minute," Abu Khalil said.

   The three deadly armed conflicts with Israel since 2008 have also taken
   a heavy toll on infrastructure and further debilitated Gaza's health
   system leaving Palestinians in Gaza facing the prospect of a
   full-fledged humanitarian catastrophe.

   As the occupying power, Israel has ultimate responsibility to ensure
   the well-being of the occupied population residing in the Gaza Strip.
   It is Israel's unlawful blockade of the coastal enclave that has placed
   ordinary Gazans like Abu Khalil and his sons at the mercy of a
   politicised bureaucracy in order to access medical treatment that many
   would take for granted as a basic right.

   But the Palestinian authorities' reduction of essential services to the
   Gaza Strip in recent months—including electricity and medical
   supplies—combined with its delay in transferring patients in need of
   treatment, demonstrates a callous disregard for the lives and health of
   Palestinians and is a particularly damning illustration of their
   willingness to hold some of the most vulnerable people hostage in order
   to score political points.

   Sadly, as ever, it is Gaza's civilians, like Abu Khalil and his sons,
   who are forced to pay the price of these disputes.
