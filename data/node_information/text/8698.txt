   CHILD IS REBORN

Destiny’s Child to reunite after Beyonce’s secret talks with Kelly Rowland
and Michelle Williams

   Exclusive
     * From Simon Boyle's Bizarre Column

     * 4 Aug 2019, 21:00
     * Updated: 4 Aug 2019, 21:35

   THEY have been Independent Women since their last studio album in 2004
   – but 15 years on, Destiny’s Child are ready to prove that the band is
   a Survivor of the music industry.

   I can reveal that Beyonce has been secretly working on getting the
   iconic pop group back together, with Kelly Rowland and Michelle
   Williams both on board.

   She wants the reunion to include brand new music and a lucrative tour
   of the US and Europe next year.

   And the timing is perfect, as it coincides with the 20th anniversary of
   Michelle joining Destiny’s Child and the group then becoming a
   chart-topping trio worldwide.

   A music insider said: “Beyonce has been desperate to get the girls back
   together with her in the studio and she can’t think of a better time
   than 2020, when they will be marking two decades as one of the world’s
   biggest all-female groups.

   “She saw the success of the Spice Girls tour and wants to replicate
   that — but far bigger and better.

   “Beyonce has been meeting with Kelly and Michelle and discussing what
   they can do.

   “It’s early days but they want to record new music and put it out
   alongside some of their biggest hits.

   “Then they want to do a tour which will be short enough for them to fit
   it into their schedules, but big enough to make sure all their fans can
   make a date to see them.

   “As well as going around the US they want to play dates in Europe,
   including the UK.

   “They are one of the very few groups where love for them has only grown
   since they went on hiatus in 2006, so the demand is massive.”

   Destiny’s Child had UK No1s with Independent Women and Survivor, and
   top five hits including Bootylicious, Emotion, Lose My Breath and
   Soldier.

   Last year, Beyonce gave her fans a taste of what is to come by bringing
   Kelly and Michelle out on stage during her headline set at US festival
   Coachella.

   If that incredible performance is anything to go by, this reunion will
   be worth the wait.

Kylie a Pride-to-be?

   THERE is just no stopping Kylie Minogue this summer.

   After being one of my Glastonbury highlights in June, she ended her
   summer tour on Saturday by headlining Brighton Pride in the city’s
   Preston Park.

   More than 250,000 people descended on the city for the celebrations,
   which included a parade, as well as performances from Clean Bandit and
   Fleur East.

   Kylie – whose various outfits included this eye-catching Jean-Paul
   Gaultier dress, pictured above, as well as the creation below –
   appealed to the crowd by adding her LGBT anthem Your Disco Needs You to
   her setlist.

   And she conducted a pretend wedding between two men during another of
   her hits, Especially For You.

   Now that Kylie has found love again, with GQ creative director Paul
   Solomons, it will be her own wedding that she will have to think about
   next.

Haz's dressing rehearsal

   IF HARRY Styles wanted his music comeback to remain a secret, he should
   have made sure everyone kept a lid on it.

   Producers on his new video tried to disguise the shoot by telling
   people it was for a mayonnaise advert, only for the penny to drop when
   fans spotted the floppy-haired singer.

   He was filming in the Lombardo Toledano neighbourhood of Cancun,
   Mexico, and the shoot took over 20 buildings including people’s homes.

   Trying to keep it schtum, several security guards were patrolling the
   area from midday on Saturday to early Sunday morning to ensure no one
   knew he was there.

   But eagle-eyed fans, eager for a follow-up to his 2017 debut solo
   album, spotted him through windows and shared clips of the star on
   social media.

   A source said: “The area was swarming with people. People in the
   neighbourhood knew filming couldn’t just be for a mayo advert, as there
   would never be so much security or such a large crew.

   “His team had bought hundreds of bouquets of violet and purple flowers
   for the video. Harry spent most of time filming inside a yellow house.”

   While the news Harry is preparing for a return to music is out, the
   song he was recording a video for thankfully didn’t leak.

   Here’s hoping they’re better at keeping that under wraps.

James bags killer track

   TWO albums down and James Bay has certainly made friends in high
   places.

   The singer-songwriter, who released second record Electric Light last
   year, has written a song titled Easy Distraction with Brandon Flowers
   from The Killers.

   Their collaboration is believed to have been the brainwave of
   songwriter Tommy King and producer Ariel Rechtshaid who have helped
   them both out with projects in the past.

   But it is not yet known who will sing it or whether they will record it
   together.

   The Killers headlined Glastonbury in June and are currently working on
   the follow-up to their 2017 album Wonderful Wonderful.

   Getting this collaboration released would be enough to live up to that
   album title.

   “The saddest part of young girls growing up in an airbrushed world is
   they’re seeking a perfection that’s not real.

   “Everyone’s eyes get used to seeing airbrushed bodies and airbrushed
   skin and, suddenly, they think that’s the norm? It isn’t. It’s fake.

   “Fake is becoming the new real. We have a completely unrealistic view
   of a woman’s body.

   “Girls, cellulite is normal. Fat is normal. It’s beautiful and natural.
   I won’t buy into the bulls*** today.”

Time to check out Nic

   NICOLE Scherzinger looked like she was keeping herself in check when
   she touched down in Sydney in this outfit.

   The former Pussycat Dolls singer looked ready for action before
   take-off as she posted a photo of herself in LA.

   But Nicole might have been feeling a bit sleepy by the time she arrived
   Down Under, as she has been flitting back and forth between the US and
   Australia to honour her filming commitments.

   Nicole is a judge on Australia’s Got Talent and is also on the panel of
   US talent show The Masked Singer.

   At least those air miles should give her a nice holiday when she
   eventually gets a week off.

Ari scores sixy success

   ARIANA Grande looks set to match a chart milestone shared by Britney
   Spears and Rod Stewart – her sixth UK No1 single.

   The US singer’s new entry, Boyfriend, was released on Friday and has
   taken an early lead in this week’s Top Ten.

   The tune with US duo Social House has pushed Shawn Mendes and Camila
   Cabello’s hit Senorita to No2 and Ed Sheeran’s Beautiful People to No3.

   Kygo and Whitney Houston’s Higher Love also jumped up the charts over
   the weekend and now sits at No6. Her last song to reach the Top Five
   was Million Dollar Bill in 2009, three years before her death.

   LOVE MACHINE

Meet Samantha, the sex robot that can be SEDUCED – and the doll’s creators
say humans are already falling in love with their machines

   Hyper-realistic bonk 'bot is so attractive that lusty men are falling
   heads over heels for its computerised charms.
     * Staff Reporter

     * 20 Oct 2017, 11:30
     * Updated: 5 Oct 2018, 9:07

   THE makers of a sex robot which can be "seduced" have claimed men are
   already "falling in love" with their creation.

   Designers of Samantha claim the plastic princess is capturing blokes'
   hearts. We've got the lowdown on the doll that has all the men
   swooning...
   Samantha "likes to be kissed", according to maker Sergi Santos

Who is Samantha the sex robot?

   Samantha is only of the recent "hyper realistic" sex dolls to hit the
   hit headlines as advances in technology mean the sex toy market has
   upped its game.

   The doll is interactive, responding to voices as well as to touch.

   She comes complete with sensors in her face, hands, breasts and  "the
   female genitals down below" and it is claimed she requires a more
   subtle approach when it comes to bedroom activities.

   Sergi Santos, the designer of a love machine called Samantha, said the
   amorous android was so erotic that men were already developing real
   feelings for her.

   But the doll isn't all about getting down and dirty, Samantha can also
   discuss philosophy, science and animals.

   She's also got a great sense of humour with more than a thousand jokes
   in her repertoire.
   Samantha featured in a segment on This Morning where her owner/lover
   Arran discussed living with the doll and incorporating her in the
   family

   Arran discussed living with the doll and incorporating her in the
   family

Where have a seen Samantha the sex robot before?

   On September 12, Samantha made a TV appearance, taking a seat on the
   famous This Morning couch with Holly and Phil with her owner Aaran.

   The presenting duo were shocked by the doll. Phil asked: “It’s a bit
   like making love to a car GPS isn’t it?”

   Arran replied: “I don’t think so.

   “Humans love human form, so obviously I think she’s very beautiful.
   Would you agree she’s very beautiful?”

   Samantha also featured in a new BBC documentary called "Can Robots Love
   Us?" on September 4, 2017.

   The programme explored the question of romance between men and
   machines.

   In the documentary, Santos and a "friend" named only as Aaron showed
   the presenter how the robot could be literally turned on and then put
   in the mood for sex.

   Sergi Santos

What do her makers say about Samantha?

   In the BBC documentary Samantha's maker Sergi Santos said: "They will
   fall in love with her. It's happening already."

   He went on to demonstrate how the doll could be "aroused" and gotten in
   the mood for sex.

   First, Santos uttered the words "get sexy" in Samantha's ears.

   She replied: "Ok then, I think I am ready to do sex stuff, do you want
   me to?"

   The owner of the bot - referred to as Aaron - advised to take a
   romantic approach to seduction, stroking her hands sensually rather
   than immediately groping her naughty areas.

   He said: "She likes to be touched. If you go straight for [her breasts]
   in the beginning, she won't like that so much."

   When her hand is gently rubbed, Samantha said: "Lovely, thank you for
   spending time with me. I enjoy being with you."

   When a finger is inserted into her mouth or her breasts and vagina are
   fondled, Samantha lets out a realistic feminine moan which is likely to
   sound unlike anything her owners have heard during encounters with real
   women.

   But will this assignation lead to love or just lust? Aaron is in doubt
   about the feelings people will develop for Samanta the sex robot.

   He explained: "Love is love. When you fall in love, nothing else
   matters."

   The experience of watching two grown men fondle a sex robot appeared to
   have a profound effect on show host James Young, a 27-year-old double
   amputee who has been fitted with robotic prosthetics.

   He grappled with the question of whether it was "inappropriate" to
   grope a love machine and said: "It's a dumb machine, but it almost
   doesn't feel consensual.

Boris Johnson rules out calling a general election before Brexit as he

   BORIS Johnson has "absolutely" ruled out calling a general election
   before the Brexit deadline day of October 31.

   The new Prime Minister also pledged £1billion to recruit an extra
   20,000 coppers as he pounded the beat in Birmingham.

   Mr Johnson restated his commitment to take the UK out of the European
   Union on or before the deadline of Halloween this year.

   The PM said: "The British people voted in 2015, in 2016, in 2017. What
   they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on
   October 31.

   "They don't want another electoral event, they don't want a referendum,
   they don't want a general election. They want us to deliver."

   In recent weeks there had been speculation that the new Conservative
   leader could take the country to the polls in a bid to consolidate his
   power base.

   Thanks to the support of the Democratic Unionists, he has a majority of
   two in the Commons - and this will possibly drop to just one by the end
   of next week if his party loses the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election.

   He was in Birmingham today on his first official visit as PM, with a
   trip to a Police Learning and Development Centre.

   And he had a walkabout meeting members of the public who mobbed him for
   selfies.

   Boris plans to recruit an extra 20,000 police officers and conduct an
   urgent review to make it easier for them to use stop and search powers
   to crack down on thugs carrying weapons.

   The pledge was central to his Tory leadership bid, and formed part of
   talks at his first Cabinet meeting yesterday.

   The move will cost nearly £1billion over three years in a nationwide
   programme.

   He said ahead of the visit today: “My job as Prime Minister is to make
   our streets safer.

   “People want to see more officers in their neighbourhoods, protecting
   the public and cutting crime.

   “I promised 20,000 extra officers and that recruitment will now start
   in earnest.”

   The first officers are expected in September.

   A new national Policing Board will be charged with ensuring forces meet
   targets by 2022.

   Insiders also said Mr Johnson wanted to roll out new stop and search
   powers nationwide.

   But Boris didn't manage to stay free of his Brexit dilemma for long, as
   he was targeted by protesters when he arrived in Birmingham.

   Brits with signs saying 'Stay in EU' and 'Brexit. Is it worth it?' were
   brandished outside.

   The visits will fuel more speculation that Boris could be planning an
   early election, though officials have insisted one isn't on the cards.
