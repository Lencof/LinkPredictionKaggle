How to use IoT and data to transform the economics of a sport

Cycling has a monetization problem. Velon, with the help of EY teams, is
changing this through realtime data and the Internet of Things (IoT).

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

How can you turn spectators into fans?

Cycling has a money problem; but with a huge fanbase to draw from, can the
sport create a platform that can effectively engage and monetize global
viewership?

   On the face of it, cycling should be easy to monetize. With more than a
   billion bicycles in the world, it’s an activity as ubiquitous as
   watching TV or going on the internet – a fundamental part of modern
   living.

   Yet, despite growing media attention and an expanding fanbase, the
   sport of cycling has been stubbornly resistant to effective
   monetization. Velon, a consortium dedicated to resolving this issue,
   came to EY teams for help.

   Velon brings together 11 teams that compete in professional cycling
   around the world. They came together to answer one critical question:
   how do we improve the economics of the sport?

     Pretty much everybody we explained the idea to said, "Forget it.
     You're crazy.

   Graham Bartlett
   CEO, Velon

   “I’ve worked in sports for 20 years, and pro road cycling has by far
   the most dysfunctional economic model,” says Graham Bartlett, CEO,
   Velon. “It really doesn’t work. The reaction to that was to form and
   create Velon.”

   Why has professional cycling been so dysfunctional? Global commercial
   cycling revenues are only $600 million – compared to $8.2 billion in
   the NFL, and $16.8 billion between just the five biggest European
   soccer leagues.

   The difference is these sports benefit from being able to host large,
   ticketed events in one place. Cycling, where races cover thousands of
   miles of open road, does not have this luxury. Without equivalent
   infrastructure, cycling struggles to achieve the commercial heights of
   other sports

   Ironically, with pro cycling it's the most dedicated fans – those
   waiting by the roadside – that can miss out the most. More casual
   viewers, watching on TV or listening on the radio, can get a more
   holistic coverage of the race: fans by the roadside can only catch a
   glimpse of the cyclists as they go past.

   But cycling does have its own assets: professional cyclists generate
   huge amounts of data, from heart rate, to bike speed to information
   about the terrain on which they are riding. Properly captured, this
   data presents a huge opportunity for cycling superfans to develop
   closer, and more intimate engagements with the sport and their
   favourite teams and riders.

   Velon has close access to these opportunities – the teams they
   represent generate terabytes of raw data every year. Velon’s goal was
   to capture, transform, and deliver this data to a global cycling
   audience of 565 million people.

   “We came up with this fascinating problem, which is how do you transmit
   thousands of data points per second out of a live sporting event while
   it moves from Bologna to Rome, all across the Alps and everywhere
   else,” remembers Bartlett. “Pretty much everybody we explained it to
   except the guys at EY said, ‘Forget it. You're crazy. You can do that
   at a stadium – and even then it's difficult – but to do it in a bike
   race that moves 200 miles down the road every day? No chance.’ EY teams
   looked at it and said, "This is a fantastic IoT challenge.’"

   And if this crazy challenge could be overcome, EY and Velon would have
   the opportunity to give fans worldwide a first-class platform through
   which to directly engage with cycling – and create the foundations for
   a truly effective commercial cycling economy.

   works.

Converting spectators into fans through data

By using IoT solutions to leverage the data generated by professional
cyclists, EY and Velon were able to build an app that brought cycling
straight to the fans.

   EY and Velon’s approach was to create an IoT solution that could
   collect the vast amounts of potential data from cyclists in races
   around the world, and turn it into interactive, revealing data
   highlights and stories, putting viewers at the heart of the race, and
   giving them deep insights into their favorite cyclists and teams
   through a dedicated app. The digital experience could then become a new
   one-stop-shop for cycling fans everywhere, building and growing a large
   audience of cycling fans and potential consumers, and forming the
   foundation for a more sustainable cycling economic model.

   “In 2015 this was a theory. It was an idea. Nobody had brought it
   alive. Some people had sort of dipped their toe in this water a few
   years before, on a very small scale, but what we wanted to do was do it
   on a massive scale,” explains Bartlett. “We wanted to show every rider
   and let people see them in ways that no one had ever done in any sport
   before, never mind road cycling.”

   Bringing together multiple teams from around the world, including the
   US, Australia, India, Denmark, and the UK, EY teams worked with Velon
   to create a platform that could achieve these aims. The solution had
   three parts:

1.  A robust IoT system to capture and transmit the required data

   The first step was to find an IoT device that could collect the
   necessary data from the cyclists. This is a small device that is placed
   under the saddle of bikes in the professional peloton. The device
   captures critical information about the cyclists as they aparticipate
   in races – all of which is  bothuseful for the teams in tracking
   performance, and fascinating for fans to follow the progress of the
   race. The information it provides includes:
     * Power
     * Cadence (the speed at which the cyclist peddled)
     * GPS information (location, bike speed, and direction of travel)
     * Heart rate information

   Velon device montage

   While it may be relatively easy to capture this data from a stationary
   exercise bike in a gym, out in the field for a sport in which races
   cover dozens of miles a day – often through remote countryside with
   limited connectivity – the logistics were staggering.

   To make matters worse, the devices also need to be removed and charged
   overnight. As races often continue for several days – and bike parts
   are changed regularly during that time – special care needs to be taken
   to ensure that each cyclist is paired with the correct device each
   morning to build up the correct aggregate race data. With data becoming
   ever more fundamental to the sport, one error in refitting a device
   could create significant problems for the teams, organizers,
   broadcasters, and Velon alike – and potentially lose the trust of the
   fans.

   “It’s been an incredibly complicated technical challenge to get that
   information, and then do something sensible with it, that we can drive
   insight from, visualize, and show to consumers in a meaningful way,”
   says Michael Henry, Director, EY Analytics. “We’re taking vast amounts
   of information across bikes that move up to 100kmph, and they’re
   travelling across thousands of miles for eight hours at a time. So
   we’ve got some incredible technical challenges when doing that, over
   mountains and incredibly isolated terrain, for long periods. We had
   challenges with water-proofing, battery life, and also the precision
   and accuracy of the bikes and where they are.”

2.  A trusted, secure central data aggregation platform

   After gathering the data on the bikes, it needs to be relayed to a
   central aggregation platform, which aggregates rider data and combines
   it with external information sources (such as team names, stats and
   route maps) to enable deeper analysis and insight.

   Even seemingly simple information like calculating rider speed can
   prove surprisingly complex out on the road, with patchy data signals
   and GPS coverage – to calculate speed required combining on-bike
   cadence and power data with GPS data, as no one information source
   would be sufficient alone.

   To compound the challenge further – some of the data being collected
   needed to be kept proprietary to the individual racing teams. After
   all, these teams are in competition, and use data to benchmark, analyze
   and improve their performances – all in a sport that generates prize
   money and sponsorship opportunities for the winners. While some of the
   aggregated data is made public, there also needs to be clear firewalls
   between sensitive information that could give competitors unfair
   insights into each other’s’ performance and tactics.

   “We are the guardian in the middle, owned and trusted by those teams,
   and they put their faith in us,” explains Bartlett. “That's why working
   with a collaborator like EY teams is essential, because you have to
   have a degree of certainty and trust that the right firewalls and the
   right positions are there, and make sure that nobody could get into
   that data. That's what we have with EY teams.”

   The solution was the EY data platform, which provides a broad
   capability for high speed streaming ingestion, storage, cognitive
   analytics and artificial intelligence. Within the Velon project, this
   provided the backbone for building the aggregation and analytics
   functions of the app.

3.  A platform for communicating those data and insights to the wider viewing
public

   The final part of the process, and of the experience, was to create a
   consumer facing platform that transformed this data into an engaging
   user experience. As Barlett puts it, “If you put onboard live cameras
   on one bike in one race, it's not interesting. If you put them on 11
   bikes, 11 teams, all of a sudden you've got an actual broadcast feed
   people will pay for. So Velon, by covering a bigger grouping and being
   a true collective, is able to do things that any individual team on its
   own can't do economically.”

   Ultimately, the user-facing app aims to give cycling fans the same kind
   of all-in-one experience fans of other sports would experience in a
   stadium: a constant overview of the state of play, running commentary
   and statistics, and a sense of community and participation in the event
   itself. As Robin Hutchinson, EY Global Digital Products and Solutions
   Leader, explains, “the app means they can watch the broadcast sitting
   on the side of the road, uploading pictures, consuming the data, and
   really getting a great experience. It changes what cycling looks like
   to the fan.”

   This third element will continue to evolve, Bartlett says: “Right now,
   we know that the fan experience that Velon is giving to people is not
   what we want it to be. We can see the future of this is in making it
   simple, contextual, engaging, and relevant – that is absolutely what
   this new deal with EY teams are all about. This is why we’re involving
   other people within the Global EY network to help us to realise that –
   because ultimately fan engagement is what this is all about.”

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

Integrating the fan into the sport for a richer experience

Creating a one-stop-shop for global cycling fans, laying the foundations for
an effective cycling business model.

   The platform has seen considerable success. Over more than two years of
   gradual rollout and development, nearly a million people have
   participated in some part of the Velon app ecosystem, and millions more
   have consumed the data via TV broadcasts.

   “What we’re basically providing is a second-screen experience. You’re
   inside the race, you get to see things that the motorcycles and the
   cameras don’t capture, you get to see things helicopters don’t capture,
   and that’s all broadcast to you in a way that gives you more fidelity
   for what’s happening in that race,” says Hutchinson.

   Curating this successful fan engagement, and creating a centralized
   platform for cycling, can then help Velon answer underlying questions
   about cycling’s economic viability.

   The platform offers Velon several routes for monetization. Sponsor and
   advertiser revenue is a clear and obvious route. A freemium model of
   the app is also being built, giving fans access to enhanced services
   and additional features, such as the ability to compare their own
   performance to that of professional racers. A third avenue is to
   leverage customer data provided via the app to support commercial
   relationships with alternative and third-party models.

   But at its heart, EY teams and Velon’s platform proves that, with the
   right data and experience, it’s possible to create a whole new way of
   talking with fans, radically transforming how they engage with their
   sport and promoting cycling more generally. This in turn promotes
   healthier lifestyles, more sustainable transport, and creates a more
   profitable, more innovative, talent-hungry cycling business sector.

   “Without EY teams we wouldn’t have been able to realize this vision.”
   says Velon CEO Graham Bartlett “The NBA aren’t doing it yet, the NFL
   aren’t doing it, nobody’s doing it. But we’re doing it. We’re already
   doing it. We’ve been doing it for over a year now. And we’ve been able
   to do that because of the collaboration with EY. Without them helping
   us build that vision, we wouldn’t be in the place that we are now.”

   Velon’s app also points the way forward for more data-enabled sport in
   general. “What is clear is that the way fans interact with sport is
   changing,” says Tom Kingsley, EY Sport Industry Group Leader in the UK.
   “Whether in a stadium, by the side of a road, or watching at home, fans
   want a much more immersive experience. What we’re developing for Velon
   will significantly improve the way cycling fans can engage with their
   sport. That has to be a good thing for fans, for teams and for the
   sport as a whole”
