Abstract

   Pleurotus citrinopileatus is an edible mushroom, which has recently
   become very popular, with a consequent increase in industrial
   production. Water-soluble polysaccharides (WSPS), extracted from edible
   mushrooms, have been found to have antitumor and immunoenhancing
   effects. In this study, we investigate the effects of WSPS extracted
   from submerged fermented medium of P. citrinopileatus on hyperglycemia
   and damaged pancreatic cells in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced
   diabetes. The diabetic rats fed with water-soluble polysaccharide of P.
   citrinopileatus (SPPC) lost less body weight than those fed SPPC-free
   regular diet. Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the
   diabetic rats fed with SPPC at a dose of 0.4 g/kg bw daily was lower
   than in the groups fed with SPPC at doses of 0.04 and 0.12 g/kg bw. The
   fasting blood glucose levels of diabetic rats fed with SPPC were 44%
   lower than the negative controls. The degree of damage to the islets of
   Langerhans of the rats fed with the highest dosage of SPPC was
   significantly lower than those fed with SPPC at doses of 0.04 and
   0.12 g/kg bw. The results showed that STZ-induced diabetic rats fed
   with SPPC might help alleviate the elevation of the level of that in
   fasting blood glucose.

Introduction

   The blood glucose level of a diabetes patient is usually controlled or
   regulated by diet, physical exercise (Heled et al. 2003), and
   medication. Medication, however, can sometimes result in side effects
   (Richter and Neises 2003). Although diabetes has no direct relation to
   mortality, it jeopardizes one's health (Kagansky et al. 2003). Thus,
   researchers are looking for natural products to effectively lower blood
   glucose levels. Up until now, certain parts of some plants, or even
   whole plants, have been discovered to have ameliorating effects on
   lowering blood glucose. For instance, it is known that dietary fiber
   can help lower insulin resistance and improve glucose tolerance
   (Chattopadhyay 1999; Wang et al. 2003; Lai et al. 2001; Meyer et al.
   2000). Through a method of tissue culture, some tea extracts have also
   been found to increase secretion of insulin (Gray and Flatt 1998).
   Experiments using animal models have been employed to prove the
   efficacy of some of these active blood glucose-lowering agents,
   including terpenoid, polysaccharides, glycosides, aldehydes, acids, and
   alcohol (Kiho et al. 1996; Richard and Polansky 2002; Ojewole 2002;
   Puri et al. 2002; Yuan et al. 1998a,b).

   Many edible mushrooms have a physiological effect on humans and
   animals, affecting the digestive system, cardiac vessel functioning,
   the immune system, as well as having anticancer, antioxidation, and
   antihyperglycemic effects (Hsu et al. 1997; Liu et al. 2000; Smith et
   al. 2002; Roy 1997). Water-soluble polysaccharides (WSPS), extracted
   from the fruiting bodies of edible mushrooms in a fermented medium,
   have been found to have antitumor and immunoenhancing effects (Mizuno
   et al. 1992; Wang et al. 2001a,b; Wasser 2002). In the study of
   diabetes, streptozotocin (STZ) can be used to induce
   insulin-independent diabetes in rats. STZ-treated rats display damage
   in their islets β cells and a reduction of T-mediated immune effect
   (Elliett et al. 1997; Szkudelski 2001). Treating STZ-induced diabetic
   rats with WSPS has been shown to possibly enhance their immunity,
   partly reduce cell damage, enhance insulin secretion, and inhibit
   increased blood glucose levels (Kurihara et al. 2003). WSPS has often
   been found to have physiological effects, especially in
   immunoenhancement, but little research has been done on its ability to
   regulate blood glucose. Although Pleurotus citrinopileatus has recently
   seen increased market demand and production, its possible role in
   medicine has not received much attention (Yakovlev et al. 2002),
   especially with current popular research interest in P. ostreatus. We
   study the antihyperglycemic effect of WSPS extracted from a fermented
   broth of a submerged culture of P. citrinopileatus in STZ-induced
   diabetic rats.

Materials and methods

Preparation and analysis of water-soluble polysaccharide

   P. citrinopileatus was cultivated in GP broth (glucose 30 g/l, peptone
   10 g/l, pH 5.5) in a shaker at 100 rpm, at 25°C for 21 days. The
   fermented broth was filtered, and then 95 and 75% ethyl alcohol (1:4,
   v/v) was successively added to the filtrate. The mixture was
   centrifuged (8,000×g, 10 min) to collect the precipitate (with a yield
   of 23.6 g/kg, dry weight), which was dissolved in water. After further
   purification through ultrafiltration (Militan System, ELO 04; Millipore
   Co., USA), molecules of more than 10^5 Da were obtained and
   lyophilized; in this study, this is referred to as water-soluble
   polysaccharide of P. citrinopileatus (SPPC) (Wang et al. 2001b). The
   content of the WSPS was determined by the phenol–sulfuric acid method
   (Chaplin and Kennedy 1994). Protein content of SPPC was determined by
   Bradford assay (Copeland 1994). The amino acids composition of the
   protein of SPPC were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography
   (HPLC), as in Official Methods of Analysis of The Association of
   Official Analytical Chemists (2003), an HPLC apparatus, Shimadzu
   LC-10AT equipped with FLD-6A detector, CTO-10A oven. The samples were
   hydrolyzed by acid (6 N HCl) and alkaline (4.2 N NaOH), respectively.
   The separation was performed on a Shim-pack Amino-Na column (6×100 mm).
   A mobile phase consisting of 0.2 N sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.18),
   0.6 N sodium citrate buffer (pH 10.0), and 0.2 N NaOH were run with a
   gradient programmed at a flow rate 0.4 ml/min.

Animals

   The 6-week-old female Wistar rats (200±10 g) were purchased from the
   National Laboratory Animal Center of Taiwan. The experiments were
   carried out in a qualified animal breeding room in the animal center at
   our institute. Protocol complied with the guidelines described in the
   “Animal Protection Law,” amended on 17 January 2001,
   Hua-Zong-(1)-Yi-Tzi-9000007530, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan,
   Taiwan, ROC. The rats were housed individually under standard
   environmental conditions (23±1°C, humidity 55±5%) with 12-h light:12-h
   dark cycles. The rats had free access to water and a semipurified diet
   (AIN-76, ICN Biochemicals Inc., CA, USA) for 7 days.

Antihyperglycemic effect of SPPC

   One group of 12 normal rats, used as a control, received a regular
   AIN-76 diet. The other experimental rats, subjected to previous fasting
   for 18 h, were injected intraperitoneally with STZ (Sigma, St. Louis,
   MO, USA) dissolved in 0.1 M cold sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at a
   dose of 65 mg/kg body weight to induce diabetes. Rats with fasting
   blood glucose levels above 250 mg/dl were included in the diabetic
   group. One group of 12 STZ-induced diabetic rats, used as a negative
   control, received a SPPC-free regular diet (SPPC-free fed group). The
   other STZ-induced diabetic rats were divided into three groups of 12
   rats each, which fed a regular AIN-76 diet with 1 ml of aqueous SPPC
   administered orally daily at a dose of 0.04, 0.12, or 0.4 g/kg of body
   weight for 20 successive days. These three SPPC-fed groups were named
   as LSPPC group, MSPPC group, and HSPPC group, individually. At the end
   of the 20 days, four rats from each of the five groups were humanely
   killed, and their pancreas immersed in 10% formalin for 24 h. The
   pancreas was then rinsed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, mounted
   on slides, and stained to make into tissue slices. The
   pathomorphological changes in the pancreatic cells and the islets of
   Langerhans were observed by microscope. The remaining rats in all the
   five groups were continued to be fed with a SPPC-free regular diet
   until the 25th day, when they were also killed (Lai et al. 2001).

Blood analysis

   Blood samples were collected, without anesthesia, from the tail vein
   into heparinized tubes and analyzed immediately. Fasting blood glucose
   was determined every 5 days, following 18 h of food deprivation. During
   the experimental period, changes in serum cholesterol and serum
   triglycerides were determined every 5 days. The percentage change in
   serum insulin was measured between the 2 days before the rats were fed
   with SPPC and the end of the 20 days of being fed SPPC. Blood glucose
   was determined using kits (Randox Lab. Ltd. Co., UK). Cholesterol and
   triglycerides were determined by Kodak Ektachem DT 60 Analyzer (Eastman
   Kodak Co., NY, USA) (Mao et al. 2002). The serum insulin levels were
   determined using Elecsys Insulin kits (Roche Diagnostics Co., IN, USA)
   (Sapin et al. 2001).

Statistical analysis

   The data are shown as the mean±SD. Data were conducted to SAS (version
   6.08) for analysis of variance, and Duncan's multiple range test was
   used to determine significant differences (P<0.05) among treatments.

Results

   After 10 days of experiment, the water intake of the HSPPC group was
   obviously lower than that of the LSPPC group (P<0.05), and there was no
   significant difference between the LSPPC and MSPPC groups (P>0.05)
   (Fig. 1). After 5 days, the water intake and urine excretion (Fig. 2)
   of the SPPC-fed groups slowly increased, although not significantly
   (P>0.05). However, the SPPC-fed groups had a lower water intake and
   urine excretion than the negative control group. After the 10th day,
   the water intake and urine excretion of the LSPPC and MSPPC groups were
   significantly lower than that of the negative control group (P<0.05).
   Figure 3 shows that there was no significant difference in the food
   intake between the negative control group and the three SPPC-fed groups
   during the experimental period (P>0.05). The food intake of the
   negative control and SPPC-fed groups was higher, however, than the
   control group (P<0.05).

   After being fed with SPPC for 5 days, the three SPPC-fed groups were
   found to have a slight decrease in body weight (Fig. 4). From the 5th
   to the 15th day, the increase in weight was higher than it was in the
   first 10 days. In particular, the increase in the body weight of the
   HSPPC group was significantly higher than that of the LSPPC and MSPPC
   groups from the 10th to the 15th day (P<0.05). When the SPPC feeding
   was stopped, the body weight of the rats in all the SPPC-fed groups had
   decreased. Figure 5 shows that the decreasing rates of fasting blood
   glucose of the LSPPC and MSPPC groups were around 3 and 4%,
   respectively, from the 5th to the 15th day. During this period of time,
   they were 16 and 23%, respectively, lower than the negative control
   group (P<0.05). The blood glucose of the HSPPC group was 44% lower than
   that of the negative control group (P<0.05). In the HSPPC group, after
   being fed with SPPC for 5 days, the reduction in blood glucose had
   reached 26%. After 15 days, the reduction trend in blood glucose had
   stabilized and decreased to close to 40% on the 20th day.

   There were no significant differences in the change in insulin between
   the LSPPC and the MSPPC groups (Table 1). However, there was a
   significant difference between the three SPPC-fed groups and the
   negative control group (P<0.05). Regarding change in appearance, after
   being fed SPPC for 20 days, the red color of the eyes of both the LSPPC
   group and the negative control group became lighter than that of the
   normal control group. After 25 days, their eyes appeared almost white.
   Their lenses also showed obvious lesions of pigmentary degeneration.
   The degree of deconformation of the islets of Langerhans of the HSPPC
   group was found to be less than that of the negative control group from
   the tissue slices by microscopic examination (illustrations not shown).
   The SPPC contained mostly carbohydrates (86% of dry weight). The major
   amino acids in protein fraction were Gln, Asp, and Lys, containing
   12.4, 10.3, and 8.3%, respectively.

   Figure 6 shows that when being fed with SPPC, the serum total
   cholesterol levels of the three SPPC-fed groups were lower than those
   of the negative control group (P<0.05). On the 15th day, the serum
   total cholesterol level of the diabetic rats fed with SPPC at a dose of
   0.4 g/kg bw was a significant 33% lower than that of the negative
   control group. Compared with the time prior to SPPC feeding, their
   serum total cholesterol level had decreased by 20%. After SPPC was no
   longer being fed to the three SPPC-fed groups, their serum total
   cholesterol levels increased significantly (P<0.05). During the
   experimental period, the serum triglyceride level of the negative
   control group was 180% higher than that of the control group (Fig. 7).
   Serum triglyceride levels of the three SPPC-fed groups were lower than
   those of the control group after rats were treated with SPPC for 10
   days (P<0.05). However, during the SPPC feeding period, there was no
   significant difference in the changes in serum triglyceride levels
   between the LSPPC and the MSPPC groups. When fed with SPPC at a dose of
   0.4 g/kg bw, SPPC-fed groups had higher serum triglyceride levels than
   the control group but lower than the negative control group (P<0.05).
   Besides, after SPPC had been stopped for 5 days (i.e., the 25th day of
   the feeding period), the serum triglyceride levels of all three
   SPPC-fed groups had increased. Compared with the first 5 days and after
   the 15th day, in the period between the 5th and 15th days, the
   decreasing percentage of serum triglyceride levels was higher (P<0.05).
   Moreover, after being fed with SPPC for 10 days, the LSPPC group was
   found to have a significantly lower serum triglyceride level than the
   other two SPPC-fed groups (P<0.05).

Discussion

   Among nature's resources, some compounds with antihyperglycemic effects
   are water extracts, whereas others are water-insoluble. The SPPC used
   in this experiment was water-soluble, and its major components were
   glucose and mannose in our previous study (Wang et al. 2005). Rao et
   al. (2001) found an aqueous extract of Momordica cymbalaria fruits at a
   dose of 0.5 g/kg bw to have a very good blood glucose lowering effect
   in diabetic rats. Substances capable of lowering blood glucose
   generally can also improve the metabolism of blood lipids. Mao et al.
   (2002) fed konjac extract to rats with a high-fat diet and found that
   their fasting blood glucose decreased at the same time their serum
   total cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased. El-Assaad et al.
   (2003) proposed the “glucolipotoxicity hypothesis” which suggests that
   elevated free fatty acids, together with hyperglycemia, are synergistic
   in causing islet β-cell damage, because high glucose inhibits fat
   oxidation. Therefore, a decrease in β-cell damage would help lower free
   fatty acids and blood glucose levels. In this study, SPPC-fed animals
   displayed different degree of elevation of the level of serum insulin
   compared to negative control group. This result is consistent with the
   response of serum triglyceride and cholesterol to SPPC, because insulin
   level in serum would enhance the degree of lipid oxidation in the blood
   (Steiner and Vranic 1982). However, the mechanism underlying the
   protection or recovery of β cell by HSPPC treatment in rats is not
   unclear.

   Some natural bioactive substances with hypoglycemic action may be
   mediated through stimulating insulin synthesis and/or secretion from
   the islets β cells (Richard and Polansky 2002; Hsu et al. 1997; Liu et
   al. 2000). Our study, through observation of pathomorphological changes
   in tissue slices, found that the degree of damage to the islets of
   Langerhans of the rats fed with SPPC at a dose of 0.4 g/kg bw was lower
   than that found in the rats in the negative control group. When SPPC is
   digested in the small intestine, it is partially hydrolyzed into
   oligosaccharide and absorbed in this form, which may have an
   immunoenhancing effect. This could be because some substances, after
   being absorbed, may cause the inhibition of the enzyme responsible for
   the metabolism of saccharides, which may lead to a decrease in the
   absorption of glucose into the blood and a subsequent lowering of blood
   glucose levels (Kurihara et al. 2003; Yakovlev et al. 2002; Xie et al.
   2002).Therefore, SPPC appears to protect pancreatic cells or delay
   their impairment. Because STZ may harm the immune system of cells, the
   function of the islets of Langerhans should be inhibited, resulting in
   the appearance of diabetic syndrome. Ahmed et al. (1998) used the fruit
   juice of Momordica charantia to explore its effects on the distribution
   and number of α, β, and γ cells in the pancreas of STZ-induced diabetic
   rats. They found that the number of β cells of diabetic rats fed with
   the fruit juice was greater than that fed with no fruit juice. We have
   also obtained water-soluble polysaccharide with 10^5 Da of molecular
   weight from a fermented medium of P. citrinopileatus to investigate its
   immunoenhancing effect on rats with artificial pulmonary metastastic
   tumors and found that SPPC could enhance proliferation of CD4^+ cells,
   CD8^+ cells, and macrophages (Wang et al. 2005).

   Yuan et al. (1998a,b) found that water-soluble polysaccharide of
   Auricularia auricular has the hypoglycemic effect in the treatment of
   diabetic KK-A^y mice. Besides reducing damage to the immune system, the
   WSPS was also found to decrease the blood glucose levels in rats
   (Elliett et al. 1997; Anjaneyulu and Ramarao 2003). Shanmugasundaram et
   al. (1990) administered water-soluble extracts, obtained from the
   leaves of Gymnema sylvestre, to STZ-induced diabetic rats and found
   that this herb induced blood glucose homeostasis, which was suggested
   that through the increased serum insulin levels may have been brought
   about by the repair or regeneration of the pancreas. The incidence of
   pathomorphological changes, in the eyes of STZ-induced diabetic rats,
   was found to be lower in those groups fed with a high dosage of SPPC
   than in the group fed with SPPC-free diet in our study. These results
   may partially show SPPC to have an antihyperglycemic effect in
   STZ-induced diabetic rats. This antihyperglycemic effect was better in
   the HSPPC group than in either the LSPPC group or the MSPPC group. Wang
   et al. (2003) found that ginseng glycopeptide had a hypoglycemic
   effect. Although the SPPC contains 14% (w/w, dry weight) protein, the
   component may play a role on the immune function, or other activities,
   which should be explored furthermore.

   The major compounds responsible for these antihyperglycemic effects may
   be contained in products produced after SPPC has been digested by the
   small intestine. This possibility warrants future investigation. After
   the SPPC supplementation was stopped, the blood glucose of the three
   SPPC-fed groups increased significantly. These results demonstrate that
   SPPC could have an antihyperglycemic effect. This corroborates the
   findings of previous studies in the antiartificial pulmonary
   metastastic and immunoenhancing effects.

Abstract

   Agricultural plastic waste can alter wildlife diversity and behavior.
   Species survival will depend on their ability to adapt to new
   environmental conditions. In a seed-producing farm, a Megachile sp.
   nest made fully with plastic was found in a trap nest. This record
   represents the first one worldwide on revealing the use of plastic in
   the total construction of a bee nest.

Keywords

Abstract

   Benzophenone-3 (BP-3; oxybenzone) is an ingredient in sunscreen lotions
   and personal-care products that protects against the damaging effects
   of ultraviolet light. Oxybenzone is an emerging contaminant of concern
   in marine environments—produced by swimmers and municipal, residential,
   and boat/ship wastewater discharges. We examined the effects of
   oxybenzone on the larval form (planula) of the coral Stylophora
   pistillata, as well as its toxicity in vitro to coral cells from this
   and six other coral species. Oxybenzone is a photo-toxicant; adverse
   effects are exacerbated in the light. Whether in darkness or light,
   oxybenzone transformed planulae from a motile state to a deformed,
   sessile condition. Planulae exhibited an increasing rate of coral
   bleaching in response to increasing concentrations of oxybenzone.
   Oxybenzone is a genotoxicant to corals, exhibiting a positive
   relationship between DNA-AP lesions and increasing oxybenzone
   concentrations. Oxybenzone is a skeletal endocrine disruptor; it
   induced ossification of the planula, encasing the entire planula in its
   own skeleton. The LC[50] of planulae exposed to oxybenzone in the light
   for an 8- and 24-h exposure was 3.1 mg/L and 139 µg/L, respectively.
   The LC[50]s for oxybenzone in darkness for the same time points were
   16.8 mg/L and 779 µg/L. Deformity EC[20] levels (24 h) of planulae
   exposed to oxybenzone were 6.5 µg/L in the light and 10 µg/L in
   darkness. Coral cell LC[50]s (4 h, in the light) for 7 different coral
   species ranges from 8 to 340 µg/L, whereas LC[20]s (4 h, in the light)
   for the same species ranges from 0.062 to 8 µg/L. Coral reef
   contamination of oxybenzone in the U.S. Virgin Islands ranged from
   75 µg/L to 1.4 mg/L, whereas Hawaiian sites were contaminated between
   0.8 and 19.2 µg/L. Oxybenzone poses a hazard to coral reef conservation
   and threatens the resiliency of coral reefs to climate change.

Notes

Acknowledgments

   The study in Israel was partially funded by the Israel Science
   Foundation (ISF) No. 1169/07 to Yossi Loya. No other organization or
   government provided Grant-in-aid funding for this project. The authors
   thank Dr. Jon Martinez and Dr. Katherine Schaefer for assistance with
   water sampling in Oahu, Hawai’i, Ms. Maya Vizel for her assistance with
   the planula exposure challenges, Dr. Gideon Winters for assistance with
   Molecular Dynamics microplate fluorimeter, and Dr. Fuad Al-Horani for
   his assistance with toxicological exposures. We sincerely thank Dr.
   Sylvia Galloway and Mr. James H. Nicholson for their work on formatting
   the figures for publication. We also wish to thank the U.S. National
   Park Service of the U.S. Virgin Islands National Park for their
   assistance. We wish to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their
   comments in improving the manuscript. C.A. Downs thanks the
   unidentified Virgin Islander in Cruz Bay who gave him insight into the
   hypothetical cause of the ecological collapse occurring at Trunk Bay;
   hypothesizing that the visible “sheen” on the surface of the water
   produced from swimmers’ sunscreen lotions was somehow impacting coral
   reef health.

Abstract

   Spiders have been suspected to be one of the most important groups of
   natural enemies of insects worldwide. To document the impact of the
   global spider community as insect predators, we present estimates of
   the biomass of annually killed insect prey. Our estimates assessed with
   two different methods suggest that the annual prey kill of the global
   spider community is in the range of 400–800 million metric tons (fresh
   weight), with insects and collembolans composing >90% of the captured
   prey. This equals approximately 1‰ of the global terrestrial net
   primary production. Spiders associated with forests and grasslands
   account for >95% of the annual prey kill of the global spider
   community, whereas spiders in other habitats are rather insignificant
   contributors over a full year. The spider communities associated with
   annual crops contribute less than 2% to the global annual prey kill.
   This, however, can be partly explained by the fact that annual crop
   fields are “disturbed habitats” with a low buildup of spider biomass
   and that agrobiont spiders often only kill prey over short time periods
   in a year. Our estimates are supported by the published results of
   exclusion experiments, showing that the number of
   herbivorous/detritivorous insects and collembolans increased
   significantly after spider removal from experimental plots. The
   presented estimates of the global annual prey kill and the relative
   contribution of spider predation in different biomes improve the
   general understanding of spider ecology and provide a first assessment
   of the global impact of this very important predator group.

Introduction

   Spiders, which evolved from an arachnid ancestor during the Devonian
   period around 400 million years ago, are among the most common and
   abundant predators in terrestrial ecosystems (Turnbull 1973; Coddington
   and Levi 1991; Selden et al. 1991). For instance, Turnbull (1973)
   calculated an overall mean density of 131 spiders m^−2 based on
   assessments from many different areas of the globe, and Nyffeler (2000)
   found an overall mean density of 152 spiders m^−2 for a large variety
   of grassland habitats. Under favorable conditions, spiders can reach
   peak densities of up to 1000 individuals m^−2 (Ellenberg et al. 1986).
   At the present time, >45,000 species of spiders are described and those
   exhibit a very diverse range of lifestyles and foraging behaviors (Wise
   1993; Platnick 2014). Barth (1997) partially attributes the
   evolutionary success of spiders to the fact that they are equipped with
   highly developed sensory systems providing individuals with detailed
   information about potential predators and prey in their surroundings.
   All spiders are carnivores, feeding predominantly on
   insects/collembolans and to a lesser extent on other spiders (Nyffeler
   1999; Birkhofer and Wolters 2012; Pekár and Toft 2015). Very rarely
   nonarthropod prey and sometimes even plant materials are consumed as a
   supplement to the arthropod diet (Symondson et al. 2002; Foelix 2011;
   Nyffeler et al. 2016). Spiders have efficient survival mechanisms given
   that they are so numerous and widespread. Their capability to survive
   under extreme conditions and to disperse by ballooning through the
   atmosphere from place to place on silken threads allowed spiders to
   colonize a wide variety of different terrestrial habitats. Some spiders
   can travel distances of up to 30 km in a single day (Thomas et al.
   2003). There is hardly any terrestrial area on this globe where spiders
   would be missing. “….Spiders exist in the most northern islands of the
   Arctic, the hottest and most arid of deserts, at the highest altitudes
   of any living organisms, in the depths of caves, in the intertidal zone
   of ocean shores, in bogs and ponds, on high, arid moorlands, sand
   dunes, and flood plains” (Turnbull 1973). Because of their high
   abundance and predominantly insectivorous feeding habits, spiders are
   suspected to be the main predators of insects (Selden 2016).

   Due to their secretive lifestyle—some species are for example nocturnal
   or hunt in litter and soil habitats—the predatory activities of the
   spiders remain largely unnoticed and it is therefore difficult to
   estimate their impact on prey. To illustrate the impact of spiders as
   insect predators, two arachnologists—W. S. Bristowe from England and A.
   L. Turnbull from Canada—previously tried to quantify the food
   consumption of spiders by means of extrapolations. In his work “A Book
   of Spiders,” Bristowe (1947) estimated that England and Wales are
   populated by roughly 2.2 × 10^12 spiders and that these spiders may
   kill ≈2.2 × 10^14 insects annually. Bristowe (1958) went one step
   further claiming that the weight of insects consumed by the entire
   British spider fauna would exceed the combined weight of all the humans
   in Great Britain. Nyffeler (2000) conducted a recalculation of
   Bristowe’s estimate and came to the conclusion that Bristowe probably
   overestimated the overall prey kill of the spiders since Great Britain
   consists predominantly of agricultural land characterized by reduced
   annual prey consumption. Turnbull (1973), on the other hand, estimated
   that the average total weight of food annually consumed by spiders
   would amount to 4.25 × 10^3 metric tons km^−2 land area. This latter
   value is of the same magnitude as the net primary production in
   terrestrial ecosystems, which is irreconcilable with ecological theory
   (Nyffeler 2000).

   Here, we provide estimates for the standing biomass of the global
   spider community and the annual biomass of prey that is killed by the
   global spider community in individual biome types and worldwide based
   on literature data.

Methods

Estimate of the standing biomass of the global spider community

   A total of 65 values of spider biomass m^−2 were gathered from the
   literature. The data were assigned to the following seven groups of
   terrestrial biomes: (1) tropical forests, (2) temperate and boreal
   forests, (3) tropical grasslands and savannas, (4) temperate grasslands
   (incl. old fields, permanent pastures, mown meadows) and Mediterranean
   shrublands, (5) annual cropland, (6) deserts, and (7) Arctic tundra. To
   retrieve comparable data, all values were converted to fresh
   weight m^−2 taking into account an average water content of the spider
   body of ≈75% (Pulz 1987). The data were pooled by computing an average
   biomass value (g m^−2) for each biome type. By extrapolation—using the
   global land cover data from Saugier et al. (2001)—the standing biomass
   of the global spider community was then computed (Table 1).

Estimate of the annual prey kill by the global spider community

   We used simple models involving few assumptions as is advised in cases
   where a field of study is still largely undeveloped (Weathers and
   Weathers 1983). Two different approaches were taken to estimate the
   annual prey kill of the global spider community. In the case of method
   I, the estimate is based on the spiders’ food requirements per unit
   body weight known from the literature in combination with spider
   biomass m^−2 values (data for various biome types being taken from the
   literature), whereas method II is based on complete assessments of the
   spiders’ annual prey kill (e.g., prey censuses in the field combined
   with web density estimates) in selected biome types published in the
   literature. The two estimation methods are based on different sets of
   studies (with zero overlap of data between the two methods).

   Prey items that are killed in webs but remain uneaten are considered
   prey as well (Nentwig 1987). This issue is playing a role when dealing
   with spider communities dominated by large-sized orb-weaving spiders
   known to often kill prey in excess (“wasteful killing”). Accordingly,
   authors who conducted prey censuses of large-sized orb weavers usually
   have taken into account the “prey killed in webs but uneaten” in their
   assessments (see Robinson and Robinson 1974; Kajak et al. 1971;
   Nyffeler 1976, 1982; Nyffeler and Benz 1978, 1979, 1989; Malt 1996). In
   other studies dealing predominantly with cursorial hunters and/or
   small-sized web-building spiders which rarely catch prey in excess
   under natural conditions (Nyffeler, pers. obs.), this issue was
   disregarded.
   Method I : Based on the spider biomass m^−2 values from Table 1 and an
   assumptive food intake rate (mg prey per mg spider body mass day^−1),
   the prey kill m^−2 day^−1 of spider communities for each of the seven
   biome types was computed. These values were extrapolated to prey
   kill m^−2 year^−1 for each biome type, considering the length of the
   spiders’ feeding season (in days, see assumptions below). By
   multiplying the prey kill m^−2 year^−1 with the corresponding area size
   of a particular biome type (based on Saugier et al. 2001), a prey kill
   subtotal was derived for each biome type. Summing up the seven
   subtotals produced an estimate of the annual prey kill of the global
   spider community (Table 2). The estimate derived by method I was based
   on the following assumptions:

   Computation of the prey kill values for each type of biome based on
   data (spider biomass m^−2) from Table 1

   - Assumption 1: Spiders have pulsed feeding patterns, with periods of
   excessive feeding (when food is very abundant) alternating with
   episodes of starvation (when prey gets scarce or spiders are inactive)
   (Turnbull 1973; Anderson 1974). During periods of high feeding
   activity, the spiders store surplus energy in their body’s interstitial
   tissue as lipid or glycogen (Foelix 2011). The spiders depend on these
   stored energy reserves during periods of starvation (e.g., on rainy
   days). To estimate the annual prey kill of the global spider community,
   we proceed from an overall mean food intake which is intermediate
   between pronounced high or low daily food consumption. After an
   extensive literature survey on spider feeding, we propose an average
   daily food ingestion rate of ≈0.1 mg per milligram spider body mass
   which is the equivalent to ≈10% of a spider’s body weight (all values
   expressed as fresh weight). A daily food intake in this order of
   magnitude appears to be typical of most species of free-living
   araneomorph spiders in forests, grasslands, and agroecosystems (see
   Edgar 1970; Robinson and Robinson 1970; Van Hook 1971; Foelix 2011;
   Nyffeler, pers. obs.) except a few rare cases of extraordinarily low
   food intake (e.g., Santana et al. 1990; Henschel 1997). In the case of
   desert spiders, a daily food ingestion rate of 0.01–0.04 mg per
   milligram spider body mass was used (see Lubin and Henschel 1996;
   Henschel 1997). Incidents of wasteful killing (and coupled with it
   “partial consumption”) in cursorial spiders apparently occur very
   rarely under natural conditions (Nyffeler, pers. obs.), and this issue
   has therefore not been taken into account in this study.

   - Assumption 2: Spiders ingest, on average, ≈80% of the biomass of a
   killed prey (Edgar 1971; Moulder and Reichle 1972). Hence, we proceed
   with the assumption that the daily prey kill equals the daily amount of
   food ingested multiplied by the factor 1.25.

   - Assumption 3: We assume that spiders forage on 365 days year^−1 in
   tropical forests, on 240 days year^−1 in deserts, on 180 days year^−1
   in temperate forests as well as tropical and temperate grasslands, on
   120 days year^−1 in the arctic tundra, and on 60–130 days year^−1 in
   annual cropland (Kajak et al. 1971; Robinson and Robinson 1970, 1973,
   1974; Breymeyer 1978; Shook 1978; Nyffeler 1982; Byzova et al. 1995).
   The contribution of winter-active spiders in terms of prey kill in
   temperate and cold climates (see Aitchison 1984) is considered to be
   very low and has therefore been neglected.

   - Assumption 4: Spider biomass in forests has in most cases been
   assessed with the Berlese-Tullgren funnel method. This technique is
   limited to the investigation of spiders on the forest floor, and the
   calculated biomass values underestimate true biomasses. In temperate
   forests, at least 20% of the spider biomass are found in the canopy and
   understory (see Turnbull 1960; Reichle and Crossley 1967; Moulder and
   Reichle 1972; Zitnanska 1981). This pattern seems to hold for tropical
   forests (see Basset et al. 1992; Silva 1996; Yanoviak et al. 2003;
   Ellwood and Foster 2004; Dial et al. 2006). By multiplying the litter
   spider biomass values with a correction factor of 1.25, estimates for
   the total spider biomass in temperate, boreal, and tropical forests
   were obtained (Table 1).

   - Assumption 5: For biomass m^−2 of spiders associated with
   Mediterranean shrublands, no data are available. We arbitrarily placed
   this biome type in the category “Temperate grasslands (old fields,
   permanent pastures, mown meadows)”. The area size of Mediterranean
   shrublands is small (2.8 × 10^12 m^2) relative to the global
   terrestrial area, and a possible error resulting from insufficient data
   can be considered to be negligible.

   Method II : The second approach is based on published studies of the
   annual prey kill of spider communities in various biome types (see
   Kirchner 1964; Reichle and Crossley 1967; Kajak et al. 1971; Van Hook
   1971; Moulder and Reichle 1972; Robinson and Robinson 1974; Luczak
   1975; Nyffeler 1976, 1982; Nyffeler and Benz 1978, 1979, 1988a,b, 1989;
   Schaefer 1990; Ysnel 1993; Jmhasly and Nentwig 1995; Malt 1996). For
   purposes of comparison, all prey kill values (including those expressed
   in terms of energy flow) were converted to grams of fresh
   weight m^−2 year^−1. Values were converted taking into account a prey
   water content of ≈75% (see Hagstrum 1970; Edgar 1971) and a caloric
   equivalent of prey of ≈23.5 kJ g^−1 dry weight (mean value from
   literature data, see Hagstrum 1970; Moulder and Reichle 1972). Thus,
   1 g fresh weight prey biomass equals ≈5.875 kJ. By means of
   extrapolation, the annual prey kill of the global spider community was
   computed, taking into account the global coverage of the different
   biome types. The global annual prey kill assessment with method II was
   based on the following assumptions:

   - Assumption 1: Assessments of the annual prey kill of spider
   communities in tropical forests are currently unavailable. In lieu
   thereof, a study by Robinson and Robinson (1974) on the prey kill by
   the web-building spider community of an insecticide-free coffee
   plantation in New Guinea was used as a surrogate. We were operating on
   the assumption that the spider communities of tropical insecticide-free
   coffee plantations are to some degree comparable to those of tropical
   forests, given that coffee plantations are inhabited to a large extent
   by tropical woodland spiders (e.g., Nephila maculata) (Robinson and
   Robinson 1973, 1974; Robinson et al. 1974; Lubin 1978). Robinson and
   Robinson (1974) came to the conclusion that the web-building spider
   community in their study killed 16 g insect prey m^−2 year^−1. These
   authors suggested that the annual prey kill may even have been twice as
   high (≈32 g insect prey m^−2 year^−1) if hunting spiders would have
   been considered. The spider density in this coffee plantation (5.8
   individuals m^−2) was higher than the reported densities in the
   understory of tropical rain forests (3.3–3.6 individuals m^−2; Rypstra
   1986; Reagan and Waide 1996). However, we have to take into account
   that coffee plants reach a height of only 3–3.5 m, whereas tropical
   forest trees grow to a height of up to 55 m (Silva 1996). The canopy of
   tropical forests is inhabited by an abundant spider fauna (Basset et
   al. 1992; Russell-Smith and Stork 1994; Silva 1996; Ellwood and Foster
   2004), and it is to be expected that those spiders kill considerable
   numbers of insects in addition to the insects killed by the spiders of
   the understory. Thus, it is well possible that the annual prey kill by
   spiders in tropical forests does exceed the conservative estimate of
   16 g insect prey m^−2 year^−1.

   - Assumption 2: Annual prey kill values for temperate forests appear to
   vary widely. Kirchner (1964) estimated an annual prey kill of
   ≈10 g m^−2 year^−1 for a semi-natural temperate forest in Central
   Europe, whereas lower values were reported for managed temperate
   forests. The annual prey kill in managed temperate deciduous forests in
   North America and Central Europe was estimated at ≈2 g m^−2 year^−1
   (calculated by combining data for the spiders of the forest floor,
   understory, and canopy [Reichle and Crossley 1967; Moulder and Reichle
   1972; Schaefer 1990]).
   - Assumption 3: Annual prey kill values for unmanaged grasslands vary
   widely from ≈2 g m^−2 year^−1 (Ysnel 1993) up to >10 g m^−2 year^−1
   (Kajak et al. 1971; Nyffeler and Benz 1989). In order to avoid
   overestimation, we used a conservative annual prey kill range of
   2–10 g m^−2 year^−1 for grasslands and savannas (Table 3). The split in
   global coverage between unmanaged grassland/savannas (13.7 × 10^12 m^2)
   vs. permanent pastures/mown meadows (28.9 × 10^12 m^2) was based on
   SAGE/GTAP data

   - Assumption 4: Published prey kill records for desert spider or arctic
   tundra communities are not available. Nevertheless, based on published
   natural history data (Polis 1991; Henschel 1997), we conclude that the
   annual prey kill in deserts is most likely very low. One might compare
   deserts to some degree to urban environments where the annual prey kill
   by spiders is also very low (0.2 g m^−2 year^−1; Nyffeler 1976).
   Supposing that the annual prey kill in deserts might be equally low as
   in urban areas, we arbitrarily assigned an assumptive value of
   ≈0.2 g m^−2 year^−1 to the spider communities in desert areas in order
   to be able to compute the global annual prey kill with method II. Due
   to many similarities between tundra and agricultural habitats
   (regarding population densities, body size composition and faunistic
   composition), we assume that the annual prey kill in arctic tundra
   sites might be comparable in magnitude to field crops in Europe
   (≈0.1–1 g m^−2 year^−1; Table 3).

   Summing up the estimated prey kill subtotals for the seven biome types
   produced a second estimate of the annual prey kill of the global spider
   community.

Results

   Based on estimates of the average spider biomass m^−2 in various
   terrestrial biomes, extrapolation suggests that the total standing
   biomass of the global spider community equals 25.09 × 10^12 g (= 25
   million metric tons fresh weight; Table 1). Biomass estimates m^−2
   follow the order forests > grasslands/shrublands > croplands, deserts,
   and tundra, which also reflects the order of total spider biomass per
   biome type worldwide.

   The calculation of the annual prey kill by the global spider community
   with method I resulted in an estimate of 721 × 10^12 g year^−1 (=
   roughly 700 million tons year^−1; Table 2). To derive an estimate to
   which degree reduced feeding activity during rainy days would affect
   the global annual prey kill, we recalculated this estimate assuming
   that it rained during one third of the feeding season with no prey
   being captured on rainy days. This simple scenario still leads to a
   global annual prey kill of 460 million tons year^−1. Estimates derived
   from method I therefore suggest that the annual prey kill of the global
   spider community may be in the range of 460–700 million tons year^−1.
   Our assessment with method II produced an estimate of the global annual
   prey kill of 395–805 × 10^12 g year^−1 (= roughly 400–800 million
   tons year^−1; Table 3). The estimates computed with the two methods are
   highly comparable in magnitude (Tables 2 and 3). Together, the two
   different methods suggest that the global annual prey kill is
   presumably in the range of 400–800 million tons year^−1.

Discussion

   Our extrapolations resulted in an estimated annual prey kill by the
   global spider community in the range of 400–800 million tons year^−1
   (Tables 2 and 3), which equals ≈1‰ of the global terrestrial net
   primary production (see Vitousek et al. 1986). For comparison, the
   human world population does consume an estimated 400 million tons of
   meat and fish annually (Bruinsma 2003; Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations 2014). Furthermore, our estimates
   for spiders appear to be of the same order of magnitude as the prey
   kill by whales (Cetacea) in the world’s oceans which has been estimated
   to be in the range of 280–500 million tons annually (Yodzis 2001). By
   contrast, the annual food consumption of all the world’s seabirds is
   estimated at 70 million tons (Brooke 2004).

Which prey groups are killed by the spider global community?

   Overall, fewer than 10 arthropod orders (Diptera, Hemiptera,
   Hymenoptera, Collembola, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, and
   Araneae) make up the majority of the prey of spiders (e.g., Turnbull
   1960; Kajak et al. 1968, 1971; Robinson and Robinson 1970, 1973, 1974;
   Nyffeler 1982, 1999). Apart from insects and collembolans, spiders are
   another important component in spider diets (“intraguild predation”
   sensu Polis et al. 1989). Spider communities in the warmer areas (often
   dominated by cursorial hunters) have a higher percentage of spiders in
   their diets than spider communities in the colder climates (see
   Nyffeler 1999; Nyffeler and Sunderland 2003) and cursorial spiders feed
   more frequently on other spiders than web-builders (Birkhofer and
   Wolters 2012). Spiders feed on all stages (eggs, immatures, and adults)
   of their arthropod prey (Nyffeler et al. 1990). In addition to this,
   some larger spiders occasionally prey on earthworms, slugs, snails, and
   small vertebrates (Foelix 2011). Also, spiders have been reported
   supplementing their animal diet by feeding on plant materials (Nyffeler
   et al. 2016).

Relative contribution of different biome categories to the global annual prey
kill

   Spiders in forests and grasslands accounted for more than 95% of the
   annual prey kill of the global spider community (i.e., 697 million
   tons year^−1 estimated with method I and 387–784 million tons year^−1
   with method II), whereas spiders in other biomes (i.e., annual crop
   fields, urban areas, deserts, arctic tundra) were less significant
   contributors to the global prey kill (24 million tons year^−1 estimated
   with method I and 8–21 million tons year^−1 with method II, Tables 2
   and 3). Forests, grasslands, and savannas cover an area of 87
   million km^2, which is about two thirds of the global terrestrial
   surface area (Saugier et al. 2001). Forests, grasslands, and savannas
   are less frequently disturbed than, e.g., agricultural or urban areas
   and allow spider populations to build up a higher biomass (Table 1).
   Both these differences explain the high prey kill in these biomes
   (Tables 2 and 3). These spiders further feed on many forest and
   grassland pest species underlining the important role of spiders as
   providers of biological control services (e.g., Juillet 1961; Kirchner
   1964, 1967; Pointing 1966; Kajak et al. 1968, 1971; Van Hook 1971;
   Jennings and Pase 1975; Furuta 1977; Schmitz 1993; Oedekoven and Joern
   1998). However, spiders do not only kill pest prey but also consume
   other beneficial arthropods (including large numbers of honey bees) in
   forest and grassland habitats (Nyffeler and Benz 1978; Malt 1996).

   In relation to pest control, it is noteworthy that the spiders
   associated with annual crops only contribute less than 2% to the global
   annual prey kill. This can be explained by the fact that annual crop
   fields are “disturbed habitats” characterized by low spider biomass and
   a relatively short feeding season (Luczak 1979; Nyffeler and Benz 1979;
   Nyffeler et al. 1994a). Nevertheless, in wheat-, rice-, and
   cotton-growing areas with no or very low pesticide usage, the presence
   of spiders (in combination with other predators) may at times have a
   beneficial effect in slowing down the population growth of hemipteran
   pests (Kiritani et al. 1972; Sunderland et al. 1986; Nyffeler and Benz
   1987, 1988a,b; Nyffeler et al. 1992, 1994a,b; Jmhasly and Nentwig 1995;
   Birkhofer et al. 2008, 2016).

   Desert spiders only account for a small percentage (≤2%) of the global
   annual prey kill, but deserts cover a vast area (27.7 million km^2) of
   the globe (Saugier et al. 2001). Due to adverse environmental
   conditions, prey availability in deserts is very low and these biomes
   are often populated by spiders in very low densities (Shook 1978; Polis
   1991; Lubin and Henschel 1996; Henschel 1997). There are exceptions to
   this trend. Polis and Hurd (1995) described small desert islands in the
   Gulf of California, Mexico, where spiders occur in extraordinarily high
   numbers as a consequence of allochthonous energy input from the ocean.
   But the area of such island deserts is so small compared to the globe’s
   total desert area that its contribution to the global spider prey kill
   must be considered as negligible. Despite the fact that prey biomass
   killed m^−2 by desert spiders appears to be relatively low compared to
   spider communities in other biomes, these arachnids are noticeable top
   predators in desert food webs (Polis and McCormick 1986; Polis 1991;
   Polis and Yamashita 1991). The relative contribution of spiders of the
   Arctic tundra to the global annual prey kill is equally low as for
   desert-living spider communities (<1%). The climatic seasonality and
   short foraging periods in this biome certainly contribute to those low
   estimates. However, spiders in the Arctic tundra (dominated by
   individuals from the family Linyphiidae) play an important ecological
   role by entrapping in their webs nutrients that originated from
   wind-blown allochthonous inputs (mostly chironomid midges). These
   nutrients are thereafter retained within the system and contribute to
   early stages of ecosystem development (Hodkinson et al. 2001).

Experimental evidence supporting our estimates of the global annual prey kill

   Our estimates of the global annual prey kill (Tables 2 and 3) imply
   that spiders exert considerable predation pressure on insect
   populations, especially in forests and grasslands. These estimates are
   supported by exclusion studies in forest and grassland habitats in
   different parts of the world (Clarke and Grant 1968; Kajak et al. 1968;
   Schmitz 1993; Oedekoven and Joern 1998; Lawrence and Wise 2000;
   Tanhuanpää et al. 2001). After spiders had been manually removed from
   experimental exclosure plots, a significant increase of the number of
   insects and collembolans was noticed compared to control plots with
   spiders. Greenstone (1978), however, stated that even though spiders
   can achieve very high densities and consume large quantities of insect
   prey, they may not necessarily have a significant role in the
   regulation of insect populations. Spiders depress herbivorous insect
   populations by 1–20% (Juillet 1961; Pointing 1966; Kirchner 1967;
   Furuta 1977; Nakamura and Nakamura 1977; Oedekoven and Joern 1998;
   Tanhuanpää et al. 2001). Acting in concert with other natural enemies
   (ants, ground beetles, predaceous bugs, birds, etc.), spider
   communities certainly exert significant predation pressure on
   herbivorous insect populations (e.g., Kajak et al. 1971).

Further evidence in support of our theory of high global prey kill by spiders

   There is also indirect support for the significance of spider predation
   in terrestrial biomes: a large number of insect species have evolved
   morphological and/or behavioral adaptations to reduce the risk of
   predation by spiders (see Eisner et al. 1964; Wise 1993). This concerns
   in particular the adults of ten thousands of species of moths,
   butterflies, and skippers (Lepidoptera) which evolved an escape
   mechanism allowing them to disentangle themselves from the webs of
   ecribellate spiders (see Eisner et al. 1964). Eisner et al. (1964)
   stated “….Moths, by virtue of the loose scales that cover their wings
   and bodies, are admirably adapted to elude capture by orb-weaving
   spiders. Rather than sticking to the web, these may simply lose some of
   their scales to the viscid threads, and then fly on.”
   Further indirect evidence for the enormous ecological significance of
   spiders is that they serve as a food source for an incredibly diverse
   complex of arthropod-eating carnivores and, given our estimated global
   spider biomass (25 million metric tons fresh weight), spiders certainly
   are a crucial source of nutrition for many predator species. An
   estimated 8000–10,000 species of highly specialized
   predators/parasitoids/parasites feed exclusively on spiders, all of
   them being evolutionarily adapted to this special lifestyle (Table 4).
   In addition to this, an estimated 3000–5000 polyphagous bird species
   include spiders in their diets. Many of these bird species feed heavily
   on spiders in certain periods (i.e., spiders constituting 20–95% of the
   birds’ prey biomass [Kuitunen and Törmälä 1983; Poulin and Lefebvre
   1996; Naef-Daenzer et al. 2000]). Likewise, many species of frogs,
   toads, salamanders, newts, lizards, snakes, shrews, mice, rats, and
   bats include spiders in their diets (Shine 1986; Schulz and Wainer
   1997; Van Sluys and Rocha 1998; Marques et al. 2006). Even fish from
   more than 20 families have been reported consuming spiders that
   mistakenly landed on the water surface after ballooning across lakes or
   that fell into water from overhanging trees (e.g., Bristowe 1941; David
   and Closs 2003).

Nonlethal effects of spiders on prey additionally increase their global
impact

   In recent years, researchers have shown experimentally that spiders not
   only affect insects by inflicting mortality on them, they additionally
   have indirect (nonlethal) effects by intimidating them to the point
   where insects reduce their feeding activity in the presence of spiders
   in order to decrease predation risk (Schmitz et al. 1997; Schmitz 1998;
   Snyder and Wise 2000; Hlivko and Rypstra 2003). Such nonlethal effects
   of spiders can result in reduced herbivore damage. Hlivko and Rypstra
   (2003) noted “….the potential impact of spiders may be underestimated
   in food web studies that only consider predation rates….” Thus, the
   spiders’ huge predation impact documented in our study (Tables 2 and 3)
   is even further enhanced due to additional nonlethal effects.

Concluding remarks

   The estimated standing biomass of the global spider community is
   impressive (≈25 million tons, Table 1). There are few groups of
   terrestrial predaceous arthropods that can compare with spiders in
   terms of abundance and biomass. An exception are ants (Formicidae
   estimated at approx. 280 million tons, Hölldobler and Wilson 1994), but
   most species of ants are omnivorous and utilize a much broader range of
   food resources including considerable amounts of plant materials
   (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990). Here, we suggest that the predation
   impact of spider communities is particularly high in forest and
   grassland biomes, with considerably lower impact in desert, urban, and
   tundra biomes. These estimates emphasize the important role that spider
   predation plays in semi-natural and natural habitats, as many
   economically important pests and disease vectors breed in those forest
   and grassland biomes. We hope that these estimates and their
   significant magnitude raise public awareness and increase the level of
   appreciation for the important global role of spiders in terrestrial
   food webs.

Abstract

   The mental map of wild chimpanzees is analyzed in the context of their
   transports of clubs and stones used for cracking two species of nuts of
   different hardness,Coula edulis andPanda oleosa, in the Tai National
   Park (Ivory Coast). For the harderPanda nuts, they transport the harder
   hammers, i.e., almost exclusively stones, hammers of greater weight,
   and the transports are longer than forCoula nuts. The analysis made for
   the transports forPanda nuts shows that they seem to remember the
   location of stones and to choose the stones so as to keep the transport
   distance minimal. The chimpanzees seem to possess an Euclidian space,
   which allows them to somehow measure and remember distances; to compare
   several such distances so as to choose the stone with the shortest
   distance to a goal tree; to correctly locate a new stone location with
   reference to different trees; and to change their reference point so as
   to measure the distance to eachPanda tree from any stone location. They
   also combine the weight and the distance. The wild chimpanzees of the
   Tai National Park seem to possess concrete operation abilities in
   spatial representation.
